Smyrna was the center of mandated emperor worship. Failure to worship him would lead to the loss of legal status, persecution, and death. The “Ten days” mentioned in Rev. 2:10 point to the ten years of the Diocletian persecution.

Pergamum was the center of the cult of Asclepius, the Greek god of healing, who was known as “the Savior” and was represented by a serpent. Jesus said this city was where Satan’s seat was located (Rev 2:12).

Some Christians, known as the Nicolaitans, advocated compromise with paganism to avoid persecution. Jesus rejected their syncretism and asked them to repent. (Rev. 2:16).

Jesus presents Himself as the one who “lived again” and “knows the tribulations” of His people. For that reason, He tells them to “fear not” any kind of evil and to remain “faithful” until they receive the “crown of life” (Rev. 2:8-11).
