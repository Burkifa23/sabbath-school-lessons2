Laodicea was a wealthy city known for its wool industry, banks filled with gold, and a medical school which produced eye salve. The city’s water supply came from hot springs near the neighboring city of Hierapolis, but by the time it reached Laodicea, the water was lukewarm.

Because of their prosperity, Laodiceans were known to be self-sufficient and proud. Similarly, Jesus rebukes the church in Laodicea for their complacency.  Though they consider themselves spiritually rich, they were actually lukewarm and blind to their spiritual condition.

Prophetically, the church in Laodicea symbolizes the spiritual condition of the church near the end of Earth’s history. The warning to clothe oneself with white garments is a reminder for believers to clothe themselves with Christ’s righteousness before it is too late.

The message to Laodicea is a plea for repentance. Jesus reminds the Laodiceans of His love for them and promises that whoever opens the door to let Him in will reign with Him on His throne.
