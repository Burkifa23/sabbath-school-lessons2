Philadelphia was located on an imperial trade road and served as the gateway —an “open door”— to a large, fertile plateau. It was constantly shaken by earthquakes that debilitated and destroyed their structures.

Christ presents himself as “the Holy One” (Reference to God in the Old Testament and to Jesus in the New Testament) and as “the True One” on whom the church may fully rely.

“The One who has the Key of David” is a reference to Hezekiah’s chief steward, Eliakim, who was given the key to the royal palace and exercised the full authority of the king Jesus has full authority and access to the heavenly storehouse. This is why he can make those great promises to His church

This church had little spiritual strength. Yet Jesus promises to open a door of opportunities that all of the enemy’s power could never shut. He also promises to preserve them during the time of trial.
