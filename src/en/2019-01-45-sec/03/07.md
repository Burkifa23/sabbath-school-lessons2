“The messages indicate a spiritual decline in the seven churches... However, along with the evident spiritual decline in the churches, there is a proportionate increase in the promises Jesus gives. Although each church is in greater decline compared to the preceding one, each receives more promises than the previous one.” (Stefanovic, Plain Revelation, 28)

“This increase in promises in proportion to the spiritual decline in the churches brings to mind Paul’s statement: “But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more” Romans 5:20” (Ibid, 29)
