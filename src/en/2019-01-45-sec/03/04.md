The glory of Sardis was rooted in its past history rather than in present reality. The city was built on top of a steep hill that made it impregnable. Because they felt so secure, the city walls were guarded carelessly.

Sardis was a trading center that provided its citizens with luxurious lifestyle. The city’s patron deity was Cybele, the Great Mother of the gods, who was believed to possess the special power of restoring the dead to life.

Most of the Christians in Sardis were spiritually dead. Jesus reprimands their spiritual lethargy and tells them to keep watch and strengthen those who still have some life in themselves. To remember how they heard and received the gospel at the beginning of their Christian experience. (Rev 3:2, 3)

This message applies prophetically to the situation of the Protestants in the post-Reformation period when the church degenerated into lifeless formalism and a state of spiritual complacency. It also applies to every generation of Christians. There are Christians who always talk in glorious terms of their past faithfulness to Christ.
