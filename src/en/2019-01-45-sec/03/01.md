title:  Jesus’ Messages to the Seven Churches
date:   12/01/2019
---

A side-by-side comparison of the 7 messages shows that each one follows the same format, consisting of:

*	An address: Jesus addresses the specific church by name
*	A self-introduction of Jesus
*	An appraisal of the church
*	Jesus counsel and a warning to the church
*	An appeal to hear the Spirit
*	Promises for the overcomer.

As we saw in last week’s lesson in our analysis of the message to the first church in Ephesus, and as we will see this week in our study of the remaining six messages, Jesus offers hope and answers the needs of each church in each situation. Hence, He surely can meet our needs today.
