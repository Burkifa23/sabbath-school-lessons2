Thyatira was a city known for its labor force. Hard work, team effort, and community support were all virtues held in high regard. What could be the possible benefits and pitfalls for a church in such an environment?

The temptation for any labor force is to unionize, and that’s what the workers in Thyatira did. Their unions, or guilds, came with unfortunate strings attached, patron god worship and fornication with temple prostitutes.  This was especially offensive to the Christian workers.

However, they would be seen as traitors for not being team players, and business did not go well for those at odds with guilds. An influential woman (referred to here as Jezebel) was convincing them that partaking in these rituals was not sinful.

While Thyatira is known for their love and service, they are being warned here not to adopt unhealthy levels of tolerance. How do we keep a healthy balance between being loving servants and remaining faithful to our Gospel calling?
