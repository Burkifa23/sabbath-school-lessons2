In the Jewish legal system, two witnesses were needed to establish something as truthful (John 8:17). Thus, the “two witnesses” (OT and NT) received the “authority” (Rev 11:3) to proclaim the “whole [message] of God” (Act 20:27).

During a period of 1260 years (538-1798) the truths proclaimed by the “two witnesses” were resisted and war against them was declared (Rev 11:7). This fight continued until the “two witnesses” were killed by human traditions such as atheism and the abolition of religion.

However, “after three days and a half [1260] a breath of life entered” (Rev 11:11) into the world. This was a great revival (the resurrection of the two witnesses) in the study of the Bible. As a result of this revival, a Second Advent movement arose, and biblical truths were restored.

Nonetheless, right before the end “the earth [shall be] made bright” (Rev 18:7) again by the proclamation of God’s message which would lead to a final battle against God’s faithful witnesses.
