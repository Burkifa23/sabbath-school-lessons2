title:  The Meaning of the Trumpets

The number seven remains a significant thematic element as we move into our assessment of the seven trumpets. In the same way that we can apply the threefold historical, universal, and prophetic interpretation to the churches and seals, we can apply it to the trumpets.

However, the emphasis of the threefold interpretation, in the case of the trumpets, has to do with God’s judgment — in the last days and throughout Christian history.

In Numbers 10:8-10, we find that trumpets were played by temple priests in many contexts (worship, harvest, battles, festivals), but that they always had the same connotation: Reminding the people to pray and reminding God to remember and act on His covenant with His people.

Do you have a daily ritual that reminds you to lean on the Lord — that He is faithful and just to address the needs of His people?
