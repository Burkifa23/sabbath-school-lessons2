Before the seventh trumpet, an interlude describes the condition (Rev 10:1-7) and the mission (10:8-11:14) of God’s people during the time of the end. The scroll the angel holds contains a message that has significance for the whole earth.

Revelation 10 echoes Daniel 12, where the scroll is sealed for “a time, times, and half a time.” This refers to the 1260 years when God’s people were persecuted in the Middle Ages. Now, their oppression is over, and the end-time events will soon unfold (Rev 12-22).

The angel’s oath provides the church the assurance that God is faithful to His promise. The time prophesied by Daniel has expired, but the end itself will be complete at the seventh trumpet.

At the time of the seventh trumpet, the mystery of God--how He will establish His eternal kingdom--will be complete (Rev 10:7). Part of this mystery was revealed on the cross (Eph 3:5-12), but its fullness will be revealed to the universe at the Second Coming (Rev 20:11-15).
