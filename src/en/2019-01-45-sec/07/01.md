The scene of the fifth seal reveals the cry of God’s faithful people for justice throughout the ages. They cried out to God saying, “How long, O Lord?” (Rev. 6:10, NKJV)

The reply from heaven urges them to wait for the day Jesus returns to earth to bring judgment on those who did evil to his followers (Revelation 6:15-17).

This message should help God’s suffering people to remain firm and believe that He hears the prayers of His people.

As we begin to study the “Seven Trumpets” we will see how God has already intervened on behalf of his suffering people, and be assured he will do the same for us.
