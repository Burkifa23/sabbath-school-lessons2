**The Commissioning of John (Rev 10:8-10)**

John’s experience echoes Ezekiel’s experience with he was called to prophetic ministry (Ez. 2:8-3:3). Ezekiel saw in a vision a scroll spread out before him, which was commanded to take and eat. Upon eating the scroll, the prophet found that “it was  sweet as honey” in his mouth (3:3) The Lord then explained to him the bitter experience he would have as he proclaimed God’s message to the people of Israel (3: 4-11)

It appears that the purpose of Revelation 10 is not just to give us a description of John’s visionary experience of eating the scroll.

It is intended to tell God’s people about what will happen in the future (Rev 1:1; 2:26). Thus, John represents the church, commissioned to proclaim the gospel throughout the world during the time between the prophetic period specified in Daniel and the Second Coming. It is during this period that, through the church, God will warn the earth’s inhabitants of His judgment (14:6-7). John’s visionary experience offers a figurative portrayal of what God’s end-time people will experience as they preach the gospel at the end time.
