Eating in the Bible symbolically describes the acceptance of a message from God. When received, the message is good news; but when it is proclaimed, it sometimes results in bitterness as it is resisted and rejected by many (Ezek 2:8-3:11; Jer 15:16).

John’s bittersweet visionary experience is connected to the unsealing of Daniel’s end-time prophecies. John represents God’s end-time people who are commissioned to communicate the gospel to the world before the end.

At the close of Daniel’s prophecy of 1260 years, God’s people are commissioned to warn the earth of the coming judgment (14:6-12). John’s visionary experience represents what God’s end-time people will experience when they preach the gospel.

John’s vision also points to the Great Disappointment experienced by the Millerites in 1844, at the close of Daniel’s prophetic period. The sweet message of Christ’s soon coming turned bitter when Jesus did not return when they expected. The commission to “prophesy again” (Rev 10:11) points to the end-time proclamation of the gospel until Christ returns (14:6-7).
