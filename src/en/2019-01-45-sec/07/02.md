As we read Revelation 8 we must have in mind the daily services of the Jewish sanctuary, especially the evening service which closely resembles the actions of the angels.

In Revelation 8:5 we notice that one angel fills the censer with fire from the altar, where the prayers of the Saints were just offered, and throws it down to the earth. This scene is a symbolical response to God’s suffering people that he has heard their prayers and will answer them.

The Seven trumpets are God’s judgments on rebellious humanity in response to the prayers of His oppressed people and these judgments follow after the death of Jesus and run consecutively throughout history until the Second Coming.

A question that the text poses is if the throwing down of the censer means that Jesus’ intercession will not last forever and that there will be a close of probationary time.
