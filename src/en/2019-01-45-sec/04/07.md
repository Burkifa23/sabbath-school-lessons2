Evidence strongly indicates that the twenty-four elders are redeemed and glorified humanity rather than angels:

1. Angels are never called elders in either the Bible or Jewish literature; they are never described as sharing God’s throne, but rather standing in God’s presence.

2. The twenty-four elders wear white garments which relate consistently to the faithful people of God (3:4–5, 18; 6:11; 7:9, 13–14). Angels are never described in Revelation as wearing white robes.

3. The elders also wear golden crowns of victory. In Greek, it is stephanos, the victory crown (see Notes on Rev. 2:10), rather than the royal crown (Gr. diadēma), which represents eternal life and which is the reward to the faithful who overcome (cf. 2:10; 3:11). The stephanos crowns are never worn by angels in the Bible. Paul believed he would receive this crown on the day of the Lord’s coming (2 Tim. 4:8)
