Pentecost signified God’s approval of Jesus’s death on the cross and marked the inauguration of Christ’s high-priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. As our Mediator, Christ ministers on behalf of believers so that they may have access to God and receive the forgiveness of sins.

One of Christ’s first acts as our High Priest was to send the Holy Spirit upon the disciples on Pentecost. The seven Spirits (Rev 5:6) denote the fullness of the activity of the Holy Spirit on earth.

Pentecost marked the beginning of God’s wholesale assault on Satan’s kingdom. Only the Holy Spirit can convince sinners of their need of salvation (John 16:8-11). With the fullness of the Holy Spirit, the gospel could be preached more effectively than before.

The following chapters of Revelation cover the ramifications of the spreading of the gospel. But no matter what happens next, because Jesus is High Priest, believers can seek God’s grace with confidence and assurance that He will help them in times of need (Heb 4:16).
