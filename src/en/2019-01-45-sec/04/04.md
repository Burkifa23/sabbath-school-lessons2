The scroll is “encrypted” and John cannot read it. The significance of the scroll and the desire of John is beyond the tantrum of a toddler not getting his way, but the desire to know more from the God that he loves. He understands the significance and necessity of knowing this message.

The encrypted message is of monumental importance; its importance alters the course of history.

The message in the scroll alters history because of the revelation of what God does, but more importantly for who He is.  

Jesus is the only one in the entire universe that can decode the message. His divine nature allows Him to understand God and His humanity allows Him to decode God to us. He is the fundamental cog of the entire message. Since “He has conquered” and since He is one of us, the truth and significance of God is opened to the entire race and the entire universe.
