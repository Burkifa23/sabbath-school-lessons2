The twenty-four elders, human beings likely resurrected and ascended with Christ, wear crowns of victory (Greek: stephanos). Why is it significant that they do not wear ruler’s crowns (Greek:diadema)?

Emperor Domitian gave himself the title “Our Lord and God.” Christians refused to bow to him and were thus suffering. In contrast, here, the twenty-four elders are bowing and laying their crowns (stephanoi) at the feet of the true Lord and God who is worthy of worship.

Will we be victors in Christ or set ourselves up as oppositional “rulers” against Him? How do we accomplish this?

Rev 4:9-11 says that whenever the four living creatures sing the twenty-four elders prostrate themselves, place their victory crowns at God’s feet, and worship Him. Even if we are victorious, our victory crowns belong to God. What does that say to us who are striving to finish the race and keep the faith?
