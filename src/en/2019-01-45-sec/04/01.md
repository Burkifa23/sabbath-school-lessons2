Last week we focused on Christ’s messages to His people on earth, however as we move forward into chapters 4 and 5 we will find symbols that will help provide the meaning of future events according to heaven’s perspective. Key themes to look for are:

* The Plan of Salvation
* The Centrality of Christ’s high-priestly ministry
* His sovereignty over the affairs of earth
* His redemption of the human race

It is also important to notice that the language has become more symbolical and not as straightforward. This is because the language comes from the history of God’s people, recorded in the Old Testament. Therefore, in order to properly interpret Revelation, one must know the Old Testament.
