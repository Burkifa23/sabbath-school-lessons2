The central theme of this passage in Revelation 5:8-14, is that the Lamb is worthy. The act of taking the scroll signifies that to Him belongs all authority and sovereignty. The universe affirms Christ’s claim.

Taking the scroll also shows that Christ holds the destiny of all humanity. He holds the keys to revealing a future filled with the hope and promise of redemption for fallen humanity.

Christ taking the scroll is cause for celebration in heaven. His worth is proclaimed in the sacrifice Jesus made on behalf of fallen humanity. He was slain (Revelation 5:9, 12) for our sins and now He “lives to make intercession” on our behalf (Hebrews 7:25).

The future of all those who place their trust in Him is secure. All creatures across our vast universe, challenged as we are by our unworthiness (Revelation 5:2, 3), are ecstatic that both in Christ and the Father, our redemption is secure.
