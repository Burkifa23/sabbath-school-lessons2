The great controversy was about Who has the right to rule? Thus, John is shown (Rev. 4:1) how the heavenly council affirmed God’s rightful rule over the universe.

John sees the throne in heaven and a rainbow. The throne symbolizes God’s rule and governing authority over creation, while the rainbow is God’s faithfulness to his promises.

He “who was” at beginning of the universe and “is” now ruling the universe, “is to come” (Rev. 4:8) will come back to restore His creation and dominion as He has faithfully promised.

For His redemptive work at the cross, He is “worthy… to receive honor and glory and praise” (Rev. 5:12). Thus, true worship recounts and celebrates God’s mighty acts of creation and redemption.
