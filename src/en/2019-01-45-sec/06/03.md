While some interpret the 144,000 as a literal number, there are compelling reasons a literal interpretation does a serious injustice to this passage. 144,000 is the product of 12 x 12 x 1,000 with the number 12 symbolizing God’s people. Thus, the 144,000 represents the totality of God’s end-time people translated from this earth without seeing death (Romans 11:26; 1 Corinthians 15:51-53).

Historically, the 12 tribes of Israel are no longer in existence. 10 tribes were forever lost during the Assyrian captivity and its policy of assimilation. The other 2 were later taken into captivity in Babylon.

Exegetically, the list of the twelve tribes here in Revelation 7 has no correspondence throughout Scripture (Numbers 1:5-15). The order (Judah first rather than Reuben) and the components (Joseph and Levi included, while idolatrous Dan and Ephraim are excluded) points to a theological rather than historical emphasis (1 Kings 12:29, 30; Hosea 4:17).

What the list emphasizes is the faithful commitment of God’s Endtime people constituting the Church, the New Israel (James 1:1).
