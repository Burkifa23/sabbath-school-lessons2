The 144,00 have the name of the Lamb and his Father written on their foreheads, just as Jesus promised the church of Philadelphia if they were faithful. This symbolizes that they bear God’s Character.

They have not defiled themselves with women, which means they have remained loyal to Jesus and resisted defiling relationships with the great harlot, Babylon, unlike all the nations that committed fornication with her.

Due to their resolute faithfulness to Jesus, they “have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb.” This group, who will not see death, will be the first of a larger harvest of people who will be resurrected, those who are loyal to God and bear his character.  

As the end draws near, we must ask ourselves, “What are our daily choices revealing about the name on our foreheads?” Are we faithful to the Lamb and follow him wherever He goes or will we commit fornication with Babylon?
