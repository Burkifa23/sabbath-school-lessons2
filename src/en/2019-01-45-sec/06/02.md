The noun “Wind” can have a dual meaning in Scripture. In this case, it has to do with strife. The image that John sees is that somehow strife and chaos are being detained while God finishes the task of sealing his people.

The process of sealing is the one that cements the relational reality of God and his children. He knows who are His and they are secure in Him. The seal at the end time functions as a sign of protection.

The Holy Spirit is the mark that establishes the reality of who is in a true relationship with God and who is not.

That relationship leads to faithfulness to God’s commands, in a very specific way to the 4th commandment. This obedience is central in distinguishing the children of God.
