The “great multitude, which no one could number” that John saw and the 144,000 are the same group of God’s end-time people. This follows the “I heard” and “I saw” pattern of Revelation, in which John first “hears” about something, and then “sees” it under a different symbol, from a different perspective.

The people belonging to the great multitude are all dressed in white. Now they are standing before God’s throne, after having been washed in the blood of the Lamb.

They are identified as the ones who have come out of the great tribulation. This is the last generation of God’s people, who have gone through the seven last plagues.

While the 144,000 are portrayed as the church militant, the great multitude is portrayed as the church triumphant, now celebrating the victory. They appear to be a multitude impossible to count because they are no longer organized into military divisions.
