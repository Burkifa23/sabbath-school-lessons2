1. Revelation describes God’s end-time people as “blameless.” This is in contrast to the people of the world, who choose to believe Satan’s lies. But what does it mean to be “blameless”?

2. The Greek word for “blameless” does not refer to a moral, sinless status, but to the fact that the 144,000 are faithful to Christ. While most people in the world are willingly deceived by Satan, God’s end-time people are loyal to Jesus and receive the love of the truth (2 Thess 2:10-11).

3. In the Bible, to be blameless means to walk with God as Noah, Abraham, and Job did. It means to reflect the true character of God, because they have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb. It is because of Jesus that they can be found “spotless” before God (2 Pet 3:14).

4. Until Jesus returns, we will always be in need of the righteousness provided to us by Jesus’ blood (Rom 3:19-24). What God asks of us is to remain loyal until the end.
