In Rev 6:17, the question is asked: “who is able to stand [on the great day of God’s wrath]?” This week, we will see the answer to that question.

The sealed people of God are revealed in Revelation 7:1-17. Chapter seven takes place between the sixth and seventh seals and acts as a sidebar conversation to the narrative of the seals.

The narrative of the scrolls revolves heavily around the Old Testament concept of blessings for righteousness and curses for unfaithfulness. The sealed people seem to be the ultimate culmination of God’s blessings due to a right relationship with God.

As we take a look at these sealed people of Rev 7:1-17 this week, ask yourselves the following questions:
* How many groups are in view in this passage?
* What is their special relationship with God?
* How might we emulate that special relationship in our lives?
