Chapter 7 answers the  question “Who will be able to stand?” People want to know who are the 144,000? The bottom line regarding the 144,00 is that they are the people who will be able to stand in the final day of God.

However, this isn’t the end of the matter. The great multitude of the latter half of chapter 7 are also the people who will be able to stand in the final day.

Does that mean God’s people will be divided at the end of time —like Catholics and Protestants? Is that what the text is saying?

No. Actually, these two groups are symbols of the one people of God.
