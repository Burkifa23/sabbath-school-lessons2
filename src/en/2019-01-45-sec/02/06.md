The most influential church in the province of Asia was located in its capital city, Ephesus. It was the largest seaport of the province and an important commercial and religious center. This city was known for the practice of magic and was notorious for immorality and superstition.

In its early days, this church was known for its faithfulness and love (Eph. 1:15). They experienced external and internal pressure, yet remained faithful and firm. They were hardworking, obedient to the truth and rejected false doctrines.

However, their love for Christ and their fellow members began to wane. Although the church stood firm and faithful, without Christ’s love even their own lamp was in danger of going out.

Prophetically, the situation in the church in Ephesus corresponds to the general situation and spiritual condition of the church from A.D. 31–100. But by the end of the first century, the church began losing the fire of its first love, thus departing from the simplicity and purity of the gospel.
