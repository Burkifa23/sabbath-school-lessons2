The suffering of the righteous and the boastful living and pride of the ungodly, troubled king David (Ps. 73:2-26). In his perplexity, he went to the sanctuary (Ps. 73:16, 17). There, God's presence gave him understanding and comfort.

The apostle John was distressed and imprisoned on a rocky island called Patmos. There, he got the news that the churches under his care, the righteous, were suffering.

John was given a vision of the resurrected Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. The Lord revealed to John mysteries of this life and the struggles it brings. This scene gave him the assurance of Christ’s presence and care — an assurance that John was to pass on to these churches and to us.

This week we will begin looking at Christ’s ministry in the heavenly sanctuary and the first of His seven special messages to His church, which also have meaning for us today.
