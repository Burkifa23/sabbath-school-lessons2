The barren, rocky island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea, was used by the Romans as a penal colony for banished political offenders. Romans authorities exiled John to Patmos because of his faithfulness to the gospel.

Here, the aged apostle endured all the hardships of Roman imprisonment. He probably was treated as a criminal, chained in fetters, given insufficient food, and forced to perform hard labor under the lash of the whip of merciless Roman guards.

For John, the servant of God, this gloomy, rocky island became the gate of heaven. There, “he had the companionship of God and Christ and the heavenly angels, and from them, he received instruction for the church for all future time.” (Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 570)

The followers of Christ should never forget that whenever they find themselves in circumstances similar to those of John, they are not left alone. The same Jesus who came to John with the words of hope and encouragement still is present with His people to sustain and support them.
