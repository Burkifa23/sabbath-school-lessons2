Throughout the Bible and in the Book of Revelation the seventh day of the week, the Sabbath, is presented as “The Lord’s day” because He is the creator and the Lord of that day. (Gn. 2:1-2; Mk. 2:28)

Revelation 1:10: John received the vision on the seventh-day Sabbath, “The Lord’s day”. This phrase is not to be confused with a similar phrase “The day of the Lord” that is used by the Bible to refer to the Second Coming of Christ (Is. 13:6–13; 2 Pet 3:10)

Amid his afflictions, this vision-filled Sabbath must have become to John a foretaste of a life free from suffering, which he and the faithful of all ages will experience after the Second Coming. The Sabbath is a day of complete deliverance (Ex. 20:11 and Dt. 5:15).

“What a Sabbath was that to the lonely exile, always precious in the sight of Christ, but now more than ever exalted! Never had he learned so much of Jesus. Never had he heard such exalted truth.” — Ellen G. White Comments, *The SDA Bible Commentary*, vol. 7, p. 955.
