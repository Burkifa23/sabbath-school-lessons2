John sees Jesus dressed as a High Priest Walking among the lampstands. This picture points to God’s promise to ancient Israel that He would walk among them as their God (Lev. 26:12).

This picture is drawn from the ritual practice in the Jerusalem temple: The daily task of an appointed priest was to keep the lamps in the Holy Place burning brightly by trimming them, replacing their wicks and refilling them with fresh oil. He knows each lamp.

Jesus identified Himself with the titles of God as “the first and. . . the last” (see Isa. 44:6, Isa. 48:12). The Greek word for “last” is *eschatos*, from which the word eschatology (the study of end-time events) comes. The focus of eschatology is on Jesus Christ, who has the last word on final events.

He is the One “‘who lives’ ” and possesses “‘the keys of Hades and of Death’” (Rev. 1:18, NKJV). By His death and resurrection, Jesus has been given the authority to open the gates of death.  All who trust in Him will rise from the grave to everlasting life (1 Cor. 15:21–23). His followers don’t need to fear.
