**Word of Encouragement to John**

Jesus came to Patmos to provide encouragement for John. John was the pastor of the churches in Asia, and as a leader, he also needed encouragement. Overwhelmed by the glory of the Lord, the aged apostle collapsed at Jesus's feet in awe, just as he had done earlier on the Mount of Transfiguration (Matt 17 6-7)"  

In turning, John once again experienced the calming hand of Christ with his reassuring words: "Stop being afraid" (from the original Greek; Rev. 1:17). John had oâ€€ten heard these words from Jesus (Matt. 14:27; 17:7; 28:10; Luke 5:10; John 6:20) Yet on Patmos these words had a special meaning for him." Ranko Stefanovic, *Plain Revelation* (Berrien Springs, MI: Andrews University Press, 2013), 25.

"As all seven messages begin alike, they also conclude alike. Each concludes with a personal appeal: "The one who has an ear, let him hear what the the Spirit says to the churches" (Rev 2:7)... Every appeal to the churches also contains a promise to the overcomers"
