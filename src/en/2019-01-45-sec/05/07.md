What is the theological meaning of the events of the opening of the seven seals?

“The key lies in Revelation 5. The scene of the opening of the seven seals thus begins with the enthronement of Christ. When in the Old Testament the newly crowned king took his place on the throne, the destiny of the entire nation was placed in his hands. The Old Testament enthronement ceremonies were usually followed by judgment actions of a newly enthroned king when he proceeded to punish those who had proven disloyal and rebellious; he would also bestow favorable benefits on the loyal adherents (cf. 1 Kings 2; 16:11; 2 Kings 9:14–10:27; 11:1, 13–16). This judgment aspect is expressed in the vision of the opening of the seven seals.[1]
