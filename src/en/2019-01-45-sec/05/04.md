title:  The Scene of the Fourth Seal

The further the church drifts from the purity of victory in Jesus, the more death reigns freely within it. Spiritual death results from spiritual war and famine.

The message of the fourth seal portrays the history of the church from the purity of the apostolic age, the days of Rome’s persecution and the church’s fall from the Gospel into worldly compromise, and now the tragedies of the Dark Ages. There is good news even in these dark days, for we worship Him who conquered over death and has the keys to Death and Hades (Revelation 1:18).

Revelation 6 repeats the messages of Revelation 2, using different images but covering the same time periods and spiritual conditions within the church.

To emphasize the Good News in the Dark Ages was difficult, but not impossible. Thankfully, the Oil of the Holy Spirit and the (new) Wine of Jesus persist even when access to the Bread of the Holy Scripture is scarce.
