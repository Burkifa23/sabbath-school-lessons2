In Revelation 6:9-10, God’s faithful martyrs are portrayed in terms of sacrificial blood poured out at the base of the earthly sanctuary’s altar. They have suffered injustice for their faithfulness and cry out for God’s vindication. This text is not discussing the state of the dead; rather, the word “soul” in the Bible denotes the whole person (Gen 2:7).

The martyred saints are given white robes representing Christ’s righteousness, which leads to their vindication. God’s people are made complete by the robe of Christ’s righteousness, not their merit.

To “wait a little longer” until the saints are complete is not a reference to a specific number of martyrs but to completeness of character (Rev 6:11). The word “number” is not found in the original text.
