Revelation 6:12-14 reveals that in the time of the end, there will be a great earthquake, the sun will turn black, the moon will turn blood red, and the stars of the sky will fall. This matches what Jesus told his disciples in Matthew 24: 29,30.

Along with these great signs, we find several groups of people, trying to hide in the mountains to escape the “the wrath of him seated on the throne and of the Lamb” (Rev. 6:15-16).

This is good news, as Paul informs his readers, when Jesus comes he will “grant relief to you who are afflicted” and inflict “vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus” (2 Thess. 1:7-10).

Who will be able to stand on that great day? Revelation 7:4 and Paul make it clear it is the sealed people of God.
