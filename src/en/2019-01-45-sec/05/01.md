Rev. 5:9-10 “You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals…” Chapter 6 continues with the idea found in the previous two chapters. Thus, Christ is “worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals…” because of his salvific work on earth.

The opening of the seals constitutes the beginning of the expansion of Christ’s kingdom by the preaching of the gospel and the consequences of its rejection. Also, the opening of the seventh seal brings the conclusion of the world’s history.

The key to understanding the meaning of the seals is found in Rev. 3:21 “ To him who overcomes…”Thus, chapter 6 is about those who are in the process of overcoming, who will be granted “to sit with [Jesus in his] throne…”
