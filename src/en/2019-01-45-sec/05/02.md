As the Lamb opens up the first seal, we find ourselves fixated on a white horse, and upon it a rider wearing a victory crown (stephanos). Is this one of the twenty four human elders who wore victory crowns in Rev 4:4?

In John 16:33, Jesus claims He had “overcome [nikao] the world.” In Rev 6:2, the rider goes out “to conquer [nikao].” True victory has already been secured by Jesus, however the process is still ongoing until His second coming.

Jesus has called us to be His hands and feet. While He has already overcome/conquered the world, we are invited to be a part of that ongoing process in Him. How do we participate in this calling?
