The change from the first seal to the second is stark. Now, war is the main result of the opening of the seal. The first seal was a victorious conquest, but now the seal reveals a lack of peace.

This idea of lack of peace, perhaps not just aims at war, but at the lack of peace and subsequent instability that comes as the gospel encounters opposition to its victorious initial proclamation.  

The Third Seal shows a logical development to the seals unfolding. Victory is followed by war, and when war occurs, normally, food becomes scarce.

But the symbolism of food in contrast to its abundance, speaks not of physical food; but of the spiritual nature of how sparse the “bread of life” would become as time passed by.

The result of war is lack of bread. That will lead to the fourth seal, death.
