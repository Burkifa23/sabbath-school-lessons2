The conclusion of the prologue of Revelation points to the true focus of the whole book: the return of Jesus in power and glory. Christ’s promise to come again is reiterated three times in the conclusion of the book (Rev. 22:7, 12, 20).

The Second Coming will mark the conclusion of this world’s history and the beginning of God’s eternal kingdom. This event is the end point toward which history moves.

Rev. 1:7 points to the literal, universally visible, and personal coming of Christ in majesty and glory. Christ will bring deliverance to his people and judgment to those inhabitants of the earth who rejected his mercy and love.

Together, the words "Even so, Amen!" express and reaffirm the certainty of His return. The book also concludes in two similar affirmations (see Rev. 22:20). He fulfills his promises. We'll see Him again!
