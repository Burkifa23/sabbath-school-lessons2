Revelation. 1:1. The purpose is to show future events, starting from the time when the book itself was written. The primary purpose of biblical prophecy is to assure that no matter what the future brings, God is in control.

Read Deuteronomy 29:29 and Rev. 22:7. Why are some things not revealed to us? What is the purpose of the things that are revealed to us?

The book's end-time prophecies are not given to satisfy our obsessive curiosity about the future. The book reveals only the things that are important for us to know.

As with all good things God has given us, prophecy can be misused and misinterpreted, as well. Read John 14:9: Important principle for the purpose of prophecy.
