Revelation. 1:1. "And he sent and signified it by his angel to His servant John" (NKJV, emphasis added). The word "signified" = Greek word *semainō*, = “to show by symbolic signs.”

The future events were shown to John in vision in symbolic presentations. The Holy Spirit guided John to record these presentations (Rev 1:2).

As a rule, the reading of the Bible presupposes a literal understanding of the text (unless the text points to intended symbolism). But when we read Revelation — unless the text points to a literal meaning — we need to interpret it symbolically. While the scenes and events predicted are real, they usually were expressed in symbolic language.

Most of the symbols in the book of Revelation were drawn from the Old Testament.
