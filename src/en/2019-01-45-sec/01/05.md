Revelation opens with the common epistolary greeting among early Christians: "Grace (Greek "*charis*") and Peace (Hebrew "*shalom*") to you (cf. Rom 1:7; 1 Pet 1:2) Grace and Peace are given by God. It is always grace and peace and never peace and grace. - Plain Revelation, 15,16.

God the Father is given the tripartite title "the One who is, and who was, and who is coming" (Rev 1:8 cf. 4:8). It echoes the divine name "I am who I am", and it points to God's eternal existence (Ex. 3:14).

"The Seven Spirits" is the term used to identify the Holy Spirit (Rev. 4:5; 5:6) with 7 being a number of fullness. The Old Testament background of this sevenfold designation of the Spirit comes from Is. 11:2; Zech. 4:2.

A threefold title "The faithful witness, the Firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev 1:5a) is used to identify Jesus. It echoes Psalm 89 (Ps. 89:27,37).
