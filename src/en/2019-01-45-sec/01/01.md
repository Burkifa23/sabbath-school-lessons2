**Title:**

Apocalypse (Revelation or Unveiling)

**Central Theme:**

Jesus Christ Jesus-Christ - who is the focal point of revelation - and His promise to be with his people as the future upholds.

**Place, Authorship and Date:**

The Island of Patmos, written by John the disciple around AD 95.

**Commentary:**

"The book was originally sent to the seven Christian congregations located in the large cities of Asia Minor- the southwestern part of modern Turkey (Rev. 1:4,11). There is sufficient evidence that, at the time, Christians suffered increasing persecution from the Romans. The worst persecution was yet to come, however. Thus the book was written to encourage Christians facing a difficult future. Although originally written to them, Revelation was not written only for them but also for all Christians through history until the time of the end. The book points to God, who is in control of the situation in the world; it also concludes with God's triumph over the forces of evil and the establishment of God's everlasting Kingdom."
