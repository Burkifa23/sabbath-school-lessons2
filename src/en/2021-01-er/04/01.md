> “The LORD has turned away from the family of Jacob. But I will wait for him. I trust that he will come to save us” (Isaiah 8:17, ERV).

A BUILDING WAS ON FIRE in New York City’s Harlem. A blind girl sat on the ledge of a 4th-floor window. The firemen were losing all hope about saving her. The firemen couldn’t fit their ladder truck between the building she was in and the building across from it. The firemen couldn’t get her to jump into a net. Of course, the girl couldn’t see the net.

“Finally her father arrives. He shouts at his daughter that there is a net below her. She must jump into the net on his command. The girl jumps. She is so relaxed that she does not break a bone or hurt a muscle in the four-story fall. She trusted her father with all her heart. That is why she did what her father said was best when she heard his voice.”—Edited by Michael P. Green, 1500 Illustrations for Biblical Preaching, page 135.

In the same way, God gives powerful proof that He wants the best for His children. But they refuse His gentle message. So, God has to shout at them to get their attention.

What lessons today can we learn from their mistakes?
