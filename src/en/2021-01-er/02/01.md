### Read for This Week’s Study
Isaiah 6:1–13; 2 Chronicles 26; Psalm 73; Hebrews 4:14–16; Revelation 5.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a very high and wonderful throne. His long robe [clothes] filled the Temple” (Isaiah 6:1, ERV).

ONE OF CONFUCIUS’ FOLLOWERS asked Confucius about the things that helped a government be a success. Confucius answered: “ ‘Enough food, enough weapons, and the people’s trust in their leaders.’ ”

Then the follower asked, “ ‘But what if you can have only two of those three things. Which one will you let go?’ ”

“ ‘Weapons,’ ” said Confucius.

“Confucius’s follower asked him, ‘But what if you must choose only one? Which one will you choose to let go?’ ”

“Confucius said, ‘Food. People have always gone hungry since time began. But if people no longer trust their rulers they are lost.’ ”—Edited by Michael P. Green, 1500 Illustrations for Biblical Preaching (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books, 1989), page 215, adapted.

People want leaders they can trust. When a soldier signed up to serve in the army a second time, the army officer asked him why. The soldier said, “I tried living the life of a citizen. But nobody is leading anyone.”

This week, we will look at the problem with Israel’s leadership and the sad things that happened.
