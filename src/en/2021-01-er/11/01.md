A JEWISH WORSHIP LEADER AND HIS WIFE get mean and nasty phone calls. The man and his wife live in Nebraska. They learn that the calls come from a leader of an American hate group named the Ku Klux Klan. The man and his wife can call the police to arrest this man. But they decide to do something different. They learn that the leader of the Ku Klux Klan is crippled. So, they show up at his door with a chicken dinner! The man is surprised. The love of this couple melts the hate in his heart. The couple continue to visit the man. He even thinks about becoming Jewish!

“ ‘Is not the time without eating which I chose, a time to take off the chains of sin, and to take the heavy load of sin off the neck [of people]? Is it not a time to let those [people] who suffer under a sinful [evil] power go free, and to break every load from their neck? Is it not a time to share your food with the hungry?’ ” (Isaiah 58:6, 7, NLV).

This week, let us learn more about the important spiritual rule that Isaiah shows us in these verses.
