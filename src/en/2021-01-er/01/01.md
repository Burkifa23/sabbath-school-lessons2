### Read for This Week’s Study
Isaiah 1; Isaiah 5:1–7.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “The Lord says, ‘Come, we will talk these things over. Your sins are red like [the same as] deep red cloth. But they can be as white as snow. Your sins are bright red. But you can be white like wool’ ” (Isaiah 1:18, ICB).

IF YOU DRIVE IN IRELAND on a small road in the country, you may see cows. The cows often block the road as they cross it to get home. These cows know where to go even if no one leads them. They will go to their owner’s barn. The cows know where they belong. They know who their owner is.

If a little boy gets lost in a store, he will yell, “I lost my mommy!” The boy may not know where his mother is. There may be several other mothers in the store. But the little boy knows exactly which mother is his own.

The Jews did not remember who they belonged to. They forgot they were God’s people. They forgot their special agreement with God. So, they lost the knowledge of who they were. “Heaven and earth, listen! This is what the LORD says: ‘I raised my children and helped them grow up, but they have turned against me. A bull [ox] knows its master, and a donkey knows where its owner feeds it. But Israel does not know me. My people do not understand’ ” (Isaiah 1:2, 3, ERV).

This week, we will look at God’s work to help His people remember that they belong to Him.
