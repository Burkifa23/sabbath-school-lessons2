> “A child will be born to us. God will give a son to us. He will be responsible for leading the people. His name will be Wonderful Counselor [Teacher], Powerful God, Father Who Lives Forever, Prince of Peace” (Isaiah 9:6, ICB).

“DR. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER was in charge of the team that built the first atom bomb. Dr. Oppenheimer answered questions about the bomb from a group of lawmakers in the United States. The group asked Dr. Oppenheimer if there was anything to keep humans safe from the atom bomb.

‘Of course,’ Dr Oppenheimer said.

“ ‘And what is that?’ the lawmakers asked.

“Dr. Oppenheimer looked at the group. ‘Peace,’ he said.”—Paul Lee Tan, editor, Encyclopedia of 7,700 Illustrations: Signs of the Times (Rockville, MD: Assurance Publishers, 1985), page 989, adapted.

Peace is just a dream for most people. Someone said that the earth has been at peace for only about 8 percent of its history. History shows us that humans broke at least 8,000 agreements (Paul Lee Tan, page 987, adapted). Everyone expected World War One to be the last war ever. But during the 50 years after World War One, we humans had only two minutes of peace for every year we had of war.

This week we will read about the only One who can give us real and everlasting peace: Jesus.
