> “At that time people will say, ‘Here is our God! He is the one we have been waiting for. He has come to save us. We have been waiting for our LORD. So we will rejoice and be happy when he saves us’ ” (Isaiah 25:9, ERV).

“A PASTOR preached a sermon about pride. When he was done, a woman who heard the sermon waited to talk with him. She was very upset. She told him that she needed to confess an awful sin.

“The pastor asked the woman, ‘What sin is that?’

“The woman said, ‘Pride. I sat for an hour in front of my mirror a few days go and admired my beauty.’

“ ‘Oh, said the pastor. ‘That was not the sin of pride. That was a sin of believing false ideas!”—C.E. Macartney, compiled Paul Lee Tan, Encyclopedia of 7,700 Illustrations: Signs of the Times (Rockville, Md.: Assurance Publishers, 1985), page 1100, adapted.

This week, we will look at how pride got started.
