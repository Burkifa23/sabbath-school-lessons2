> “ ‘Nations will come to your light. And kings will see the shining-greatness [glory] of the Lord on you’ ” (Isaiah 60:3, NLV).

“WE MUST LEARN in the school of Jesus. God wants to bless us when we accept His special agreement. But He cannot give those blessings to us if we do not accept what Jesus did for us on the cross. Often, we try to get these blessings on our own. We think we can do something to earn the favor of God or make ourselves worthy of His blessing. But this idea is wrong. We must look away from ourselves to Jesus. We must believe He is a living Savior. We must not think that our own good behavior will save us. The mercy of Jesus is our only hope. The Lord gives us this promise: ‘Let those [people] who are evil stop doing evil things. And let them quit thinking evil thoughts. Let them turn to the LORD. The LORD will show them his tender love. Let them turn to our God. He is always ready to forgive’ (Isaiah 55:7, NIrV). We must believe the promise of God. We must not think that feeling is faith. We must trust God fully. We must depend on Jesus and what He did to save us. He is our Savior. Then God will give us all the help we need.”—Ellen G. White, Faith and Works, page 36, adapted.

This week we will study the writings of Isaiah to learn more about this important Bible truth.
