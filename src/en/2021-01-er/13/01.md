> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “ ‘Look, I will make new heavens [skies] and a new earth. And people will not remember the past. They will not think about those things’ ” (Isaiah 65:17, ICB).

BILLY was a 12-year-old boy. He finished reading a book about the stars. Then he refused to go to school anymore. His mother took him to the family doctor. The doctor asked, “Billy, what is wrong? Why do you not want to study or go to school anymore?”

Billy said, “Because, Doctor, I read a book about the stars. It says that the sun will burn up in the future. Then all life on earth will die. So, why should I go to school if everything will die in the end?”

The mother shouted, “That is not for you to worry about!”

The doctor smiled at Billy. He said, “But, Billy, you do not need to worry about that. By the time that happens, we all will already be dead for a long time.”

Of course, that is part of the problem: in the end, we will all be dead.

But death does not need to be the final thing that happens to us. God offers us everlasting life on an earth that He will make new.
