> “ ‘Here is my servant, the one I support. He is the one I chose, and I am pleased with him. I will put my Spirit in him. And he will bring justice [show what is right from wrong] to all nations [people groups]’ ” (Isaiah 42:1, ICB).

“MANY PEOPLE want to visit the places where Jesus was born and lived while He was on this earth. People want to walk where Jesus walked. They want to look at the lake where He loved to teach. They want to see the hills and valleys that He saw. But we do not need to go to Nazareth, to Capernaum, or to Bethany if we want to walk in the steps of Jesus. We will find His footprints next to the bed of the sick. The footprints of Jesus are in the house of the poor. The footprints of Jesus are in the crowded side streets of big cities. The footprints of Jesus are in every place where human hearts need comfort. So, we must do the work that Jesus did. Then we will walk in His footsteps.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, page 640, adapted.

Isaiah talked about a servant of the Lord. This servant shows mercy, the same as Jesus did: “ ‘He will not break a crushed blade of grass. He will not put out even a weak flame. . . . You will help the blind to see. You will free those who are in prison’ ” (Isaiah 42:3, 7, ICB).

Who is this Servant? What work does He do?
