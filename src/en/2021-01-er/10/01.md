### Read for This Week’s Study
Isaiah 50:4–10; Isaiah 52:13–53:12; Isaiah 53:3–9; Isaiah 53:10–12.

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “But he was being punished for what we did. He was crushed because of our guilt. He took the punishment we deserved [earned], and this brought us peace” (Isaiah 53:5, ERV).

LOUGH FOOK is a Chinese Christian. His heart is filled with pity for many people from His country who are slaves in mines in Africa. Lough Fook wants to give these Chinese slaves the hope in the Good News about Jesus. But how can Lough Fook go to them? He came up with the answer. He will sell himself as a slave for five years. Then he is sent to the mines in Demerara. He works in the mines and tells many people about Jesus.

Then Lough Fook dies. But not before 200 people accept Jesus as their Savior.

Lough Fook is a powerful example of someone who gives up everything to help other people. Wow! What an example of the love of God!

Jesus also became “a servant” (Philippians 2:7, ERV). Jesus came to help people. They were slaves to sin. Jesus came to give them hope and make them free.

Isaiah told us all about this work. Isaiah told us about it many hundreds of years before Jesus came to this earth. This week, we will look at what Isaiah said about Jesus.
