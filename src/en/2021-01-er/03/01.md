### Read for This Week’s Study
Isaiah 7:1–14; 2 Kings 15:37, 38; 2 Kings 16:5–9; 2 Chronicles 28:16; James 2:22.

> “ ‘ “If your faith is not strong, then you will not have strength to last” ’ ” (Isaiah 7:9, ICB).

ROY AND CONNIE pull into their drive after church on Sabbath. One of their pet hens flies in fear across the yard in front of them. Something is wrong. Their hens were safely locked in their pen when Roy and Connie left for church. But now they got out. Soon Roy and Connie learn the sad reason. The neighbor’s small dog, Beethoven, escaped her yard. Now she is down by the pond with Roy and Connie’s hen Daisy in her mouth. Daisy is a beautiful hen with fluffy white tail feathers. Connie is too late to save Daisy. Connie’s precious pet soon dies in her arms. Connie sits down in the yard. She holds the pet and cries.

Another pet is deeply upset. A tall, white duck named Waddlesworth sees Connie holding Daisy. Waddlesworth thinks Connie has killed Daisy. So, for the next few weeks, Waddlesworth attacks Connie whenever he sees her. He bites and pinches her hard with his strong bill. Sometimes it is as hard for us as it is for Waddlesworth to know our friends from our enemies.

This week we’ll look at a king of Judah who also had this problem. We’ll try to understand why he made the wrong choices he did.
