> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “The great gift that God has for us does not depend on the law. If it did, it would no longer depend on the promise. But God gave it to Abraham as a free gift through a promise” (Galatians 3:18, NIrV).

A top adviser to a president was asked, “Has the president kept all the promises that he made during his campaign?” The adviser answered, “The president has kept all the promises he intended to keep.”

At one time or another, who has not broken a promise? And who has not had a promise made to him or her broken?

Sometimes people make promises, and they fully mean to keep them. But later on, they break them. Others make promises they never mean to keep at all. It is all a lie.

But we are very blessed, because God’s promises are different. The Bible is sure. So, we can trust God to do what He says. “ ‘I will bring about what I have said. I will do what I have planned’ ” (Isaiah 46:11, NIrV).

In this week’s lesson, Paul points our attention to a special relationship. It is the relationship between God’s promises to Abraham and the law given to Israel 430 years later. What is the relationship between God’s promises and the law? And how does that relationship change the way the gospel is preached?
