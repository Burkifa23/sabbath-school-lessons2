### Read for this week’s lesson
Galatians 4:12–20; 1 Corinthians 11:1; Philippians 3:17; 1 Corinthians 9:19– 23; 2 Corinthians 4:7–12.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “I make my appeal [request] to you, brothers and sisters. [I am] asking you to become like me. After all, I became like you” (Galatians 4:12, NIrV).

So far, we have seen how Paul uses very strong words to deal with the Galatians. But his strong words point to how deeply he feels about the spiritual well-being of the church he started. Paul’s letter to the Galatians shows just how important the correct teachings are. Suppose for a moment that right beliefs and right actions were not important. Then why would Paul have cared so much about these things in his letter? The truth is that, yes, what we believe and what we do matter greatly. And that is especially true of the gospel.

In Galatians 4:12–20, Paul continues his discussion. But now he changes his approach to the topic. Paul has made many arguments to win over the Galatians to his way of thinking. But now he makes a more personal appeal or request. Paul is not like the false teachers who have no true interest in the Galatians. Instead, he shows true concern, worry, hope, and love for them in the way a good shepherd does for his flock. Paul is not just correcting their wrong beliefs. He is serving the people he loves.
