_Galatians 3:21_

Paul feels his statements might cause his attackers to think he has a low opinion of the law. Why? Because Paul talks about how God’s promises are more important than everything. Paul’s attackers might think such talk means Paul is putting down the law. So, Paul asks his attackers the very question they are thinking, “Are you saying the law goes against the promises of God?” Paul answers with a strong, “No!” God’s promises to Abraham could never disagree with the law. Why? Because God could never go against Himself. He gave both the promise and the law. But the two have different purposes in the plan of salvation.

`Read Galatians 3:21; Leviticus 18:5; and Deuteronomy 6:24. What do these verses tell us about the purpose of the law? What false ideas did Paul’s attackers have about the purpose of the law instead?`

Paul’s attackers believed the law gave them spiritual life. They may have gotten this wrong idea from misunderstanding certain verses, such as Leviticus 18:5 and Deuteronomy 6:24. These verses talk about how life should be lived by those in a special relationship with God. The law governed life within the relationship. But Paul’s attackers wrongly believed the law was the cause of that relationship. The Bible is clear: only God and His Spirit can “give life” to the spiritually dead (Romans 4:17, NIrV; read also 2 Kings 5:7; Nehemiah 9:6; John 5:21). The law cannot give spiritual life to anyone. But this fact does not mean that the law is against God’s promise of eternal life.

Paul wants to prove that the law cannot give life. So in Galatians 3:22, he says, “The whole world is controlled by the power of sin” (GW). In Romans 3:9–19, Paul uses Old Testament verses to show just how bad we are. He starts with the heart of the sin problem—selfishness. Then he moves to verses that show how widespread sin is.

Paul’s point? Sin affects everyone, and the law is limited. So the promise of eternal life can come to us only through Christ. Here again, we see the great truth that led Martin Luther to break the power of Rome.

`The law cannot save us. But what great benefits do we receive from obeying it? That is, what good have you experienced in your life through obedience to God’s law?`
