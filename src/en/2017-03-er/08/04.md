_Galatians 4:4, NIrV_

In Galatians 4:4, Paul uses the word “chosen” to show how God personally worked out His plan to save us. Jesus did not come at just any time. He came at the exact time God chose. It was a very good time in history, known as the Pax Romana. Pax Romana means Roman peace. It lasted for more than 200 years. It was a time when people felt safe and secure across the Roman Empire. Rome had conquered the Mediterranean world. This victory brought peace. It made travel easier. People also spoke the same language, and they shared the same way of life. These things helped to spread the gospel quickly. God chose this time for the coming of His Son (read Daniel 9:24–27).

`Read John 1:14; Galatians 4:4, 5; Romans 8:3, 4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5–8; Hebrews 2:14–18; and Hebrews 4:14, 15. According to these verses, why did Jesus need to become human to save us?`

Galatians 4:4, 5 is one of the shortest descriptions of the gospel in the whole Bible. It tells how Jesus came into human history. His coming was no accident. For God took the first step toward saving us. The words “God sent His Son” teach that Jesus is God (John 1:1–3, 18; Philippians 2:5–9; Colossians 1:15–17). God did not send us a heavenly messenger. God Himself came, for only God could save us.

Jesus is God. He is God’s own Son. He has been with God from the beginning. But “a woman gave birth to him” (NIrV). This verse tells us Jesus truly became human.

The wording “born under the law” (NKJV) points to the fact that Jesus was born in order to die for our sins.

Christ needed to become human. Why? Because we could not save ourselves. He is divine. But He joined Himself with fallen humans. By doing so, Christ became our legal Substitute, Savior, and High Priest. He was the “second” Adam. He came to win back everything the first Adam lost by disobeying God (Romans 5:12–21). Christ was obedient to the law. He met all the law’s holy requirements. He won the victory where Adam failed. Christ’s death on the cross satisfied the just requirements of the law. The law demanded the death of the sinner. But Christ died in our place. And His death gave Him the right to save all who come to Him in true faith and surrender to Him.
