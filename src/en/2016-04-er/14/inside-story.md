#### Finding Spiritual Meaning 

_by Vojtech Pekarik_ 

I grew up in Košice, Slovakia, a city in the easternmost part of the former Czechoslovakia. When I was 15 my parents divorced. My mother moved to Prague, while I remained with my father. 

I wanted to be considered “cool” in high school, so at age 16 I began to smoke and drink. Soon I realized that these drugs left me emptier than before, and I began looking around for something that would really satisfy me.

Our neighbors were quite religious, and when my mother came to visit us, she stayed with this family. They invited us to go to some of their meetings. I began to realize that God does exist, and that He loves and cares about me. 

When my father realized that I was seriously interested in religion, he directed me to the family’s traditional belief in Catholicism. He arranged for me to take classes from the priest, and I began attending mass every Sunday. 

A few weeks later, I noticed a poster advertising a Bible study group that was forming in our neighborhood. For several months, I attended both the Bible studies in my neighborhood and the doctrinal classes at the Catholic church. The priest heard about the Bible studies and forbade his parishioners to attend. He threatened that anyone who attended the Bible studies would be excommunicated. 

But I liked the interesting Bible study sessions. We were encouraged to follow the Bible rather than the teachings of a church—any church. The pastor spoke of the true biblical church. I didn’t know such a church existed and asked the pastor to tell us which church believed these principles. He told us it was the Seventh-day Adventist Church. I had heard the name. In the previous meeting, we had discussed the Sabbath, and I went home and looked “Sabbath” up in the dictionary—a Communist, atheistic dictionary, and it actually named Seventh-day Adventists as Sabbath keepers! 

The Bible studies were followed by an evangelistic campaign. Soon I was convinced that the Seventh-day Adventist Church was the true church. When I saw how many young people gave their hearts to Jesus, my heart was touched, too, and I decided to start a new life with Jesus. Eight months after my first Bible study with the Adventists, I was baptized.

Young—and not so young—people still are searching for meaning in life. Your mission offerings help to provide ways for them to find answers. Thank you for giving.
