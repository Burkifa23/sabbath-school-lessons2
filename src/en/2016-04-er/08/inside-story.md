### The Devil’s Lies: Part 1

Rui lived with his grandparents in Portugal. When he was 7 years old, his grandparents died. Rui wanted to know what happened to people when they died, but his uncle, with whom he’d gone to live, didn’t have the answers.

Rui began a long search for answers. He started by attending a Sunday School near his uncle’s home. Hoping to find answers to his spiritual questions there, he often recited the prayers he had memorized, but he couldn’t seem to bridge the gap between himself and God.

Rui bought a Bible, hoping it would help him to understand God. But because he had been taught that common people can’t understand it, he placed it on a shelf of honor and didn’t read it.

Then one day he moved the Bible to clean the shelf. The Bible flipped open to Exodus 20. Rui noticed that the page heading said “The Ten Commandments.” He sat down and read the chapter. He had memorized the Ten Commandments in church, but he was startled to find that the commandments in the Bible differed from those he had memorized.

That Sunday he asked the priest why the commandments he had learned in church differed from those in the Bible. He was disappointed when the priest simply told him to follow the commandments of the church and ignore the Bible version. Rui’s frustration grew. He stopped attending the church, but the emptiness in his life remained.

Rui remembered hearing his relatives say that his grandmother used to speak to spirits. Rui wondered whether he had the same ability. Feeling frustrated because he couldn’t find the answers to his spiritual questions in church, he decided to seek the answers from the dead.

He went to meetings to call on the spirits and soon began to sense a spiritual presence with him. Soon he was deeply involved in the spirit world. He found a book on witchcraft and began studying it. But some of the instructions were so horrifying that he destroyed everything he had that related to the spirits. He kept only his Bible.

Rui again began searching for answers about God. He attended several churches and asked many questions. But what they told him left him confused and frustrated.
