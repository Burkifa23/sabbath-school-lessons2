### Out of the Whirlwind

### READ FOR THIS WEEK’S LESSON: Job 38–39; John 1:29; Matthew 16:13; 1 Corinthians 1:18–27; Job 40:1–4; Job 42:1–6; Luke 5:1–8.

> <p>MEMORY VERSE:</p>
> “ ‘Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Tell me, if you know’ ” (Job 38:4, NIrV).

JOB AND EACH OF HIS FRIENDS might be different from one another. But they are all the same in one thing. Each man has a lot to say about God—or what he understands God is like. Much of what they say we can agree on. How about this idea, for example: “ ‘But ask the animals what God does. They will teach you. Or ask the birds of the air. They will tell you. Or speak to the earth. It will teach you. Or let the fish of the ocean educate you. Are there any of those creatures that don’t [do not] know what the powerful hand of the Lord has done? He holds the life of every creature in his hand. He controls the breath of every human being’ ” (Job 12:7–10, NIrV). Or this idea: “ ‘Does God ever treat people unfairly? Does the Mighty [Strong] One [God] make what is wrong appear to be right?’ ” (Job 8:3, NIrV)? 

The theme of the book is Job’s suffering. But the important point of discussion is God. Except for the first two chapters, the Lord remains hidden. God stays in the background as the book continues. 

But all that is about to change. God now will speak for Himself.
