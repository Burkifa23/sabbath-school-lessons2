### Beautiful in God’s Time: Part 1

Mihaela was the only child in her close-knit Romanian family. Her par- ents were teachers, and the family enjoyed spending time together.

When Mihaela’s mother began attending the Seventh-day Adventist Church, her father didn’t object, but Mihaela did. She was 18 at the time and challenged her mother’s new ideas. When her mother took off her jewelry, Mihaela told her that she looked naked. Nevertheless, Mihaela still loved her mother and wanted to please her.

When Mihaela entered the university, she often found her thoughts drift- ing toward God and religion. She thought about what her mother had told her about Adventist beliefs and even defended those beliefs in debates with other students. But she resisted a deeper interest in religion. She reasoned that she was young and had a lifetime to think about God and religion.

While studying at the university, Mihaela met a popular young man. It seemed that every girl on campus wanted to date him. He was handsome and charming, and his family was wealthy. But he chose to date Mihaela. When she was 21, the young couple married. Mihaela felt that God had showered her with approval by allowing her to marry such a desirable man.

The young couple often visited their families. While Mihaela’s parents enjoyed a peaceful home filled with intellectual pursuits, her husband’s family didn’t enjoy close-knit family pleasures.

Mihaela’s in-laws stopped supporting their son’s studies when he married, so when Mihaela graduated, she took a job to help pay his tuition. She didn’t have to work on Saturdays and usually spent the day doing housework. But she often found herself wrestling with her conscience over what her mother had taught her about proper Sabbath keeping.

As time passed and her husband still hadn’t finished his studies, the young couple began having problems in their marriage. Often when a crisis came, she would pray that if God would help them resolve their problems, she would become an Adventist. But when the crisis passed, she forgot her promise.

When Mihaela’s in-laws learned that her husband hadn’t finished school when he said he had, they became angry with him and accused him of wasting his life and their money. Angry, he called Mihaela at work and told her that they were moving out of the apartment his parents had gotten them. “I’ll quit school and provide for my family with my own hands!” he announced boldly.

Reluctantly, Mihaela returned home and packed up their things. They moved in with his sister, who lived in the same town. Mihaela continued working while her husband worked on obtaining visas to leave the country.
