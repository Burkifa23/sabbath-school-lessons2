## Sabbath afternoon

### Read for This Week’s Study:
Job 1, Job 2, 1 Cor. 4:9, Gen. 3:1–8, Phil. 4:11–13, Matt. 4:1–11, Phil. 2:5–8.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “But he said to her, ‘You speak as one of the fool- ish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?’ In all this Job did not sin with his lips” (Job 2:10, NKJV).

The book of Job opens up to us a whole new dimension of reality. It gives us a glimpse into the great controversy between Christ and Satan. And by doing so, it also provides us a template, a frame, an outline to help us better understand the world that we live in, a world that so often baffles, dazes, even frightens us with what it tosses our way. But the book of Job also shows that this great controversy is not merely someone else’s fight, in that we have nothing to do with it. If only that were the case; unfortunately, it’s not: “ ‘Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time’ ” (Rev. 12:12, NKJV). Satan has come down to the earth and to the sea, and we know for ourselves that his wrath is indeed great. Who among us, as flesh, hasn’t felt that wrath?

This week we will continue to look at the first two chapters of Job as we seek to get a greater understanding of how we fit in as the great controversy continues to rage.
