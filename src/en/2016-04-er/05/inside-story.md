One Friday evening, Elena cried throughout the church service. The visiting minister noticed and asked the pastor about her. When he learned that she had problems with her family, he offered her a job car- ing for his children. Elena knew that her father would never permit her to work for a Seventh-day Adventist Church, so she told the Adventist minister that she would let him know later whether or not she could accept his kind offer.

During the following week, Elena asked her father several times for permission to work for this family, but he always refused. “Why won’t you let me work for these people?” Elena finally asked him. “You have told me to look to Adventists for my food, but you won’t let me work for Adventists.”

Finally, he gave permission for Elena to go work for the Adventist family. She was thrilled. She could live with an Adventist family, attend every worship service, enjoy family worship, and read her Bible and Adventist books without fear. She grew spiritually during the year she lived with this family. But then the pastor moved, and Elena faced returning to her father’s home.

Her brother had moved to Spain, and Elena convinced her father to allow her to join her brother there. Her father allowed her to go, sure that his son would keep her from the Adventist church. But when her brother met her at the station, he astounded her with an invitation. “This Sabbath let’s go to church.” He had begun to attend the Adventist church! The two went to church together, and in a short time Elena was baptized.

As time went on, however, and Elena still hadn’t been able to find work in Spain, she began to think about returning to Romania. But her brother challenged her. “Where is your faith? I thought you trusted God!” Elena realized that her brother was watching her and that she must be strong. They prayed that she would find work, and soon she found work with a family that gave her Sabbaths off.

Elena’s father now regrets the harsh words that he spoke to her, but he has told her that if she ever returns home, she must leave her reli- gion behind. And that, she says, she will never do.
