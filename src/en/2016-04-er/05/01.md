## Sabbath afternoon

### Read for This Week’s Study:
<a class="verse" verse="Job 3:1–10">Job 3:1–10</a>, <a class="verse" verse="John 11:11–14">John 11:11–14</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Job 6:1–3, 7:1–11">Job 6:1–3, 7:1–11</a>, <a class="verse" verse="James 4:14">James 4:14</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Job 7:17–21">Job 7:17–21</a>, <a class="verse" verse="Ps 8:4–6">Ps. 8:4–6</a>.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “ ‘You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and by Your will they exist and were created’ ” (<a class="verse" verse="Revelation 4:11">Revelation 4:11</a>, NKJV).

As we read the story of Job, we have two distinct advantages: first, knowing how it ends, and second, knowing the back- ground, the cosmic conflict operating behind the scenes.

Job knew none of this. All he knew was that he was going along in his life just fine when suddenly one calamity after another, one trag- edy after another, swooped down upon him. And next, this man, “the greatest of all the people of the East” (<a class="verse" verse="Job 1:3">Job 1:3</a>, NKJV), was reduced to mourning and grieving on a pile of ashes.

As we continue to study Job, let’s try to put ourselves in Job’s posi- tion, for this will help us better understand the confusion, the anger, the sorrow that he was going through. And in one sense this shouldn’t be very hard for us, should it? Not that we have experienced what Job did, but that who among us, born of human flesh in a fallen world, doesn’t know something of the perplexity that tragedy and suffering brings, especially when we seek to serve the Lord faithfully and do what is right in His sight?
