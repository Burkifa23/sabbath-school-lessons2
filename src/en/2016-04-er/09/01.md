### Hints of Hope

#### READ FOR THIS WEEK’S LESSON:
Proverbs 17:28; Job 13:1–15; James 2:20–22; 1 Corinthians 15:11–20; 1 Peter 1:18–20; Genesis 22:8.

> <p>MEMORY VERSE:</p>
> “ ‘No matter how things turn out, I’m [I am] sure I’ll [I will] still be saved. After all, no ungodly person would dare to come into his [God’s] court’ ” (Job 13:16, NIrV).

BRITISH WRITER WILLIAM HAZLITT ONCE wrote, “Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps. This is because he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things are, and what they should be.”

Things surely are not what they should be. But for Christians who live with the promise of the Second Coming, there is hope. We have a great hope of what things will become (2 Peter 3:13). They will become something so wonderful that we, with sin-darkened minds (1 Corinthians 13:12), cannot imagine them now. The narrow, worldly mind lost this hope long ago.

This week we continue to study the question of suffering in the book of Job. Sad and unfair events hit Job unmercifully. But we will  nd that Job could still speak words of hope.

What was that hope? And what does it tell us that we can hope in too?
