The concept of a struggle, a controversy, between good and evil is found in many cultures. The idea has persisted throughout the millennia, often expressed through myths. Today, because of the influ- ence of higher criticism and modernist rationalism, many Christians deny the reality of a literal devil and evil angels. These were, the argument goes, just a primitive culture’s symbols for human and natural evil. From our perspective as Seventh-day Adventists, it’s hard to imagine how anyone makes sense of the Bible at all without belief in the reality of the devil and his angels.

Not all Christians have fallen for the deception that denies the reality of this cosmic conflict between supernatural forces of good and evil. An evangelical scholar named Gregory Boyd, for instance, has writ- ten extensively on the reality of the age-long (but not eternal) battle between God and Satan. In the introduction to his book God at War, after commenting on a few passages in Daniel 10, Boyd wrote: “The Bible from beginning to end presupposes spiritual beings who exist ‘between’ humanity and God and whose behavior significantly affects human existence, for better or for worse. Indeed, just such a concep- tion, I argue in this work, lies at the center of the biblical worldview.” —Gregory A. Boyd, God at War (Downer’s Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1997), p. 11. How correct he is.

### Discussion Questions:
- ```What other texts talk about Satan and other demonic powers? What is lost if these are interpreted as merely symbols for the dark side of humanity?```
- ```Niccolò Machiavelli, a Florentine writer of the sixteenth cen- tury, said that it was much better for a ruler to be feared by his subjects than to be loved by them. In contrast, Ellen G. White wrote, “Even when it was decided that he could no longer remain in heaven, Infinite Wisdom did not destroy Satan. Since the service of love can alone be acceptable to God, the allegiance of His crea- tures must rest upon a conviction of His justice and benevolence. The inhabitants of heaven and of other worlds, being unprepared to comprehend the nature or consequences of sin, could not then have seen the justice and mercy of God in the destruction of Satan. Had he been immediately blotted from existence, they would have served God from fear rather than from love.”—The Great Controversy, pp. 498, 499. Why does God want us to serve Him from love and not fear?```
