### The Character of Job

### READ FOR THIS WEEK’S LESSON
Job 1:1, 8; Job 29:8–17; Job 31:1–23; Exodus 20:17; Matthew 7:22–27; Matthew 5:16; Ephesians 3:10.

> <p>MEMORY VERSE:</p>
> “So you see that what he [Abraham] believed and what he did were working together. What he did made his faith complete” (James 2:22, NIrV). 

WE HAVE STUDIED ALL THE MAJOR THEMES in the book of Job. But we must not forget another important theme: that of Job himself. Who is this man whom the Lord trusts so much that He challenges the devil over his faithfulness? Who is this man who does not understand why all these terrible things are happening to him? He knows that what is happening to him is not fair. He shows anger and frustration over it all. But he stays faithful right through to the end.

The book of Job covers Job’s experience after the terrible events of chapter 1 happen. But from his story we can pick up information about his earlier life. And what we learn about Job’s past and the kind of man he is gives us a greater understanding of why Job stays faithful to the Lord, even during all his terrible suffering, even during everything Satan does to turn him away from God.

What is Job like? What can we learn about how he lives that can help us become more faithful followers of the Lord as we live our own lives?
