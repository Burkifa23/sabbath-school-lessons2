### Read for this week’s lesson
Romans 9.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “So God does what he wants to do. He shows mercy to one person and makes another [person] stubborn” (Romans 9:18, NIrV).

"The holy writings say, ‘I [God] loved Jacob, but hated Esau.’ . . . God said to Moses, ‘I will have . . . loving-pity for anyone I want to’ ” (Romans 9:13, 15, NLV).

How should we understand Paul’s words in Romans 9:13, 15, and 18? What about the freedom that humans have to choose? We are free to choose God or reject Him, right? Or, do these verses teach us that God chooses to save some people, while He chooses not to save other people, even if those people choose to be saved?

Paul says that God can pick any person or people to be His “chosen” people. After all, God is in charge of the work of telling everyone on the earth about the Good News. So, God can choose anyone He wants to do this work. What is more, God cuts off no one from being saved. God can choose anyone He wants to serve Him. God’s choice does not go against our freedom to choose. In fact, God gives every person the power to choose. More important, God’s choice does not go against the truth that He wants everyone to be saved.

So, we remember that Romans 9 is not discussing who is saved or not. Instead, Romans 9 is talking about the fact that God chose certain people to do a special work for Him.
