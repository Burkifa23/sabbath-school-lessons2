### Read for this week’s lesson
Romans 8:1-7.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “Those [people] who belong to Christ [Jesus] will not suffer the punishment of sin” (Romans 8:1, NLV).

Romans 8 is Paul’s answer to Romans 7. In Romans 7, Paul speaks about defeat, failure, and guilt. In Romans 8, the guilt is gone. Freedom and victory in Jesus take guilt’s place in Paul’s life.

Paul gives a warning in Romans 7 to those who refuse to accept Jesus Christ. What happens if you refuse? Then the awful experience in Romans 7 will be yours. You will be a slave to sin. You will not be able to do what you choose to do. In Romans 8, Paul says Jesus offers to free us from sin. Jesus gives us the freedom to do the good that our evil hearts will not allow us to do.

Paul tells us that the freedom Jesus offers us was bought for us at a price we could never hope to repay. Jesus, the Son of God, became human. Jesus became human so He could connect with us and be our perfect Example. Jesus became our Substitute who died in our place. “He came to earth in a body of flesh” (Romans 8:3, NLV). We can do everything the law asks us to do because Jesus did all these things for us (Romans 8:4). Jesus made it possible for us to have victory   over sin and obey the law. We obey because we are saved. But obedience to the law *never* can save us. Both Paul and Luther preached this message. We must preach this same message to everyone too.
