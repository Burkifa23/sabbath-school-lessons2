### Read for this week’s lesson
Romans 14-16.

> <p>Memory verse</p>
>  “Why do you try to say your Christian brother is right or wrong? Why do you hate your Christian brother? We will all stand before God to be judged by Him” (Romans 14:10, NLV).

We are now in the last part of our study about Romans. The book of Romans helped start the Protestant Reformation. The Reformation was a time in the 1500s when people began to “wake up” to Bible truths. More than any other book, Romans shows us why we are Protestants and why *we must stay that way*. As Protestants and Seventh-day Adventists, we believe in the rule of *sola Scriptura*. *Sola Scriptura* means the Bible alone has the power to tell us what to believe. The Bible taught us the important truth that we are saved by faith. This truth caused Luther to break the power of Rome. This truth is found in Paul’s letter to the Romans.

What is the best way to say what Paul’s letter means? Perhaps, the jailer in Acts 16:30 says it best: “ ‘What must I do to be saved?’ ” (NLV). The book of Romans answers that question. But the answer the Bible gives was not the same one that the church gave to people in Luther’s time. And so, the Reformation began. Here we are today because of the things that happened back then.

How did Paul end this letter? Paul is Luther’s spiritual father and our father too. We are Paul’s spiritual children.
