#### Timely Lesson

_By Godwin K. Lekundayo_

God taught me about heaven’s understanding of time when, as a district pastor, I led a three-week evangelistic series in my homeland, Tanzania.

Local organizers chose the dry season for the meetings in Moshi, a city at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro. But heavy rains started to fall after the first week. Worried that the rain would keep people at home, I suggested that we reschedule the meetings for later.

To my surprise, the chairman of the local evangelistic committee, a lay person, refused.

“No, pastor, we are not going to postpone,” he said. “We have been praying about these meetings, and our Lord heard our prayers and knew the rain would fall.”

“So, what shall we do?” I said. “You can see that it is raining heavily.”

“We have to have a little faith to believe that our God can be sensitive about the time of the meetings,” he said. “Let us pray this way, ‘Our good Lord, You can allow the rains to fall as much as You wish, but let there be no rain from 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.’ This way people will have 30 minutes to travel to the 4:00 p.m. meetings and 30 minutes to return home after the meetings end at 6:00 p.m.”

I wasn’t sure about such a request, but I joined in the prayer.

The next morning, the rain fell in torrents. The downpour continued into the afternoon. But exactly at 3:30 p.m., it stopped. Our meeting started at 4:00 p.m., and I preached until 6:00 p.m. The rain started again at 6:30 p.m.

The weather followed this schedule for two weeks. Rain poured down until 3:30 p.m., stopped, and then started again at 6:30 p.m.

One day, a visitor arrived at the meeting site at 3:00 p.m. to get a good seat. He waited for some time and, seeing the heavy downpour, decided that the meeting would be canceled and left. The next day he asked whether we had met.

“Of course,” I replied. “We didn’t ask God to stop the rain at 3:00 p.m. We asked for 3:30 p.m., so you should have been sensitive about that.”

“I’ll never make that mistake again,” the man said.

On the last Sabbath, I baptized 12 people in a river. As I brought the last person out of the water, the rain started to fall. The experience taught me that God is sensitive to time. While God may not face time constraints as we do, He does expect us to be sensitive to time, too, and to be good stewards of time. Paul tells us in Ephesians 5:15, 16, “See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time” (NKJV).
