#### “I Want to Plant a Church”

_By Andrew Mcchesney, Adventist Mission_

Julio Ovalle was bursting with enthusiasm when he returned home from a Global Mission conference organized for church members across Mexico. He excitedly told his wife, María Díaz, about what he had learned at the event in January 2017. “Now I want to plant a church,” he said.

María liked the idea. “Let’s do it!” she said.

But where to start? Julio wanted to reach out to a new neighborhood, and he thought a good way to start would be to teach people about essential health principles such as air, water, sunshine, and rest. Julio and María won support from the North Mexican Union to work as volunteer Global Mission pioneers, and their church pastor also backed the plans. But some church members remembered that a previous attempt to plant a church had failed.

“This plan will never work,” said one.

“You won’t get any good results,” said another.

Julio, María, and their two adult daughters donned bright-green T-shirts bearing the name of the health program, “I Want to Live Healthy,” and began to knock on people’s doors. At each house, they invited people to sign up for health courses at home and healthy cooking classes at church.

The family worked intensively for four weeks and finally signed up the first person, a 60-year-old man named Rogelio, for Bible studies.

When church members saw the family’s diligence and learned about Rogelio, a few donned bright-green T-shirts and joined them in going doorto-door. Before long, the group swelled to 15 people.

The church members worked incessantly for six months. Seeing a growing number of people studying the Bible, Julio decided to form a small group to meet on Sabbath afternoons. He announced the plan to the church in February 2017 and invited more church members to join the effort. The church endorsed the small group, and 10 members accepted the invitation to get involved. Moreover, a church member who rented out a hall for birthdays and weddings offered the place free of charge to the small group. Twenty-five Bible-study participants showed up for the small group’s first meeting.

Three months after being endorsed as a small group, the local conference recognized it as a branch Sabbath School. Seventeen months later, in September 2018, it became a church. Today, Puerta del Cielo (Door of Heaven) Seventh-day Adventist Church has 35 members, including 24 people baptized through Julio and María’s health classes. Sabbath attendance reaches 50 people. Plans are under way to construct a church building. “Our goal is to raise up the church and to raise up more souls for the kingdom,” said Julio, 46.
