`How does the good news of Jesusâ€™ death and resurrection keep us from needing to judge others?`

`Describe a time when you contemplated the goodness of God and were led to repentance.`

`How have you been the victim of unjust judgment?`

`How can we work together to create churches that pursue faithfulness to God without becoming judgmental?`

`When have you experienced grace instead of a judgment of condemnation in your local congregation?`

`When have you had a positive experience of a friend evaluating your discipleship to help rather than condemn?`

`Since the judgment evaluates the direction of the life, which direction are you going?`
