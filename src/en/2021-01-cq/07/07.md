`Have you ever felt the law arouse sinful passions in your life?`

`In what ways can you identify with Paul’s failure to do the things he wants to do and his failure to avoid the things he doesn’t want to do?`

`Have you ever felt wretched because of your sin? How did you resolve this feeling?`

`As we come closer to Jesus, why do we perceive ourselves as more sinful? Or less sinful?`

`Why doesn’t this perception change happen to some people? How can we help?`

`How does developing an accurate perception of our sinfulness lead to discouragement?`

`Is there someone you can encourage this week? Who is it, and how?`
