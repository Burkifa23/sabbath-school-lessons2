`Describe a time when you have prayerfully studied God’s Word to navigate a tricky moral dilemma.`

`How have you deliberately chosen to associate with the humble? Why or why not?`

`In what ways has following Jesus helped you to cultivate greater empathy?`

`Have you ever struggled to live at peace with someone? Did you do all you could? How did it resolve?`

`How can preferring others over ourselves contribute to unity in the church?`

`What does it mean to love without hypocrisy?`

`How have you used your gifts to build up the body of Christ?`

`Have you fallen into the ditch of either pride or self-deprecation? How has Jesus’ death in your behalf helped resolve this mistake?`
