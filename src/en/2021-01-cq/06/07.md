`Since giving your life to Christ, in what ways have you struggled to see authentic change?`

`What does it mean to you to reckon yourself dead to sin and alive to God? How have you put this into practice in your life?`

`Why or why not are you comfortable with the idea that we cannot escape the fact that we are slaves of sin or righteousness?`

`What do you think Paul means when he encourages us to present our members as slaves of righteousness (Romans 6:19)?`

`What do you think Paul means when he says that we are free from the dominion of sin because we are not under law but under grace?`

`How does this teaching about not being under law but under grace have any practical value in your life?`

`How does sin remain in our mortal bodies even though we donâ€™t let it reign (Romans 6:12)?`
