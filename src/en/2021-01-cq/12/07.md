`What is the difference between a test of Christian faith and areas of opinion?`

`What things are there that may not be intrinsically sinful but you avoid them because of their association with your former life?`

`Recall a time when you quarreled over an opinion. How did it make you less (or more) spiritual?`

`Why do you think people feel it is so important to be right about their opinions?`

`In what ways could you modify your behavior to support those with weaker faith in your community?`

`How have people made you feel welcome in a community?`

`How can we create a more welcoming church?`
