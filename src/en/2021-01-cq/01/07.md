`When was a time you were not ashamed of the gospel and boldly shared your faith? Share.`

`How have you seen the gospel to be the power of God in your life?`

`How do you feel about a God who has wrath toward sin?`

`How do you see Jesus when you study the Old Testament?`

`What are the tendencies toward idolatry in your life?`
