**Exploration:** Rom. 13:7, 8

**CONCLUDE**

At the end of the day, debt is a debilitating disease that thousands of people face on a chronic basis. Being debt-free has almost become a phenomenon in our entitled, fast-paced, lack-of-delayed-gratification society. Many people find themselves enslaved to debt and therefore constantly think about money or the lack thereof. Jesus wants to free us from our debt, so letâ€™s come up with a plan to become debt-free at last.

**CONSIDER**

- Setting a goal for your debt repayment plan. Try using a cash system for purchases instead of a credit card.
- Drawing a thermometer and marking your debt in increments up to the total. Color it in red every time that you pay some off and reward yourself at each level.
- Making a dream wall of things you want to buy or do and people you want to help when you are debt-free.
- Doing a budget for your household so that you are living below your means.
- Reading books on finance and money management.
- Booking an appointment with a financial advisor.
- Mentoring a young person on finances, living debt-free, and the importance of paying God first through our tithes and offerings.
