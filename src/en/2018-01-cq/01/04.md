**Evidence**: Rom. 12:2

Very few verses in Scripture are so pointed and strategic as is Romans 12:2.

After committing the first eleven chapters to deep-rooted theology, Paul flips over to address important aspects of Christian wholesomeness: duty, conduct, and behavior.

**Walk the Talk**

As in any game, when you reach the last break before the final whistle, the coach has some crucial commands that, if heeded, will make the path to victory easier. Read Romans 12:2 in sincerity. It will change you from the inside out.

One word that stands out in my mind is metamorphosis (Greek metamorphóo).

This describes the process of how a tadpole turns into a frog and a caterpillar, into a butterfly. That is exactly what God wants for His children. If we yield to the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we will be transformed and be able to completely surrender ourselves to God.

**Why Do We Struggle?**

During experiments aboard the space shuttle Columbia, scientists discovered that there are twenty-six lakes underneath the Sahara Desert.

It’s heartrending to think of the people who are starving and dying of thirst because these hidden reservoirs have not yet been tapped. As stewards of God, we have to lead people to the Fountain of living waters, Jesus Christ.

**React**

`1. Is there anything or anyone you are withholding from God?`

`2. What about your finances and hobbies?`
