EDUCATION includes what are known as “the arts and sciences.” These are college studies that include language, the study of books, writing, the study of wisdom, and scientific ideas. What does it mean to teach the arts and sciences from the Bible? Does it simply mean that we choose Bible verses that talk about some part of modern medicine or art history? Yes, but this is only part of Bible education. The education that the Bible supports is more than including Bible verses into a schoolbook. Bible education is about God’s work to save humans from sin.

God’s Word, the Bible, must be part of all our education from painting to the study of the smallest life forms that we can see only with a microscope. Without the Bible, we can run the risk of failing to see that God is very powerful. We also may not see that He is the One who made us. The Bible also helps us to see that God’s power keeps life going. The Bible teaches us to see how much God cares about us and everything He made. Then we understand better how we should teach each subject.

This week we will look at some important rules. These rules help us to know the best way to teach the arts and sciences in Christian education.
