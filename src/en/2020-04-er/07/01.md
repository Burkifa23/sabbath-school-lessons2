### Read for This Week’s Study

> “Give the LORD praise worthy of his glory. Come into his presence [where He is] with your offerings. Worship the LORD in all his holy beauty” (1 Chronicles 16:29, ERV).

WORSHIP is part of who we are as humans. God gave us freedom when He made us. We are free to worship Him. We worship God because we love Him. He is worthy of our worship too. Worship must have been very easy for humans before the Fall, right? At that time, humans saw God face-to-face. There was no sin or death on the earth. It is hard for us to make a picture in our minds about how the earth looked at that time. So, that makes it difficult for us to really understand how wonderful worship was back then.

Today, of course, we continue to need to worship God. But sin has made a mess of worship. So, we can end up worshiping the wrong things. Or, we even end up worshiping the Lord in the wrong way. (Mark 7:1–13 and Jeremiah 7:4 talk about wrong examples of worship.)

Worship is an important part of the Christian experience. So, Christian education must teach us about worship. That is why Christian education is the topic for this week’s lesson.
