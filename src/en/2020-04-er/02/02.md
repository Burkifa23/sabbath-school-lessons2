We don’t have any information in the first few chapters of Genesis about the family education in the earliest days of human history. But we do know that children learned what they need to know from their families.

“The family was the center for education in Eden. Adam was ‘the son of God’ (Luke 3:38). Adam and Eve were God’s children. They learned from their Father. Their school was a family school.”—Ellen G. White, Education, page 33, adapted.

`Read Genesis 1–2; Genesis 3:1–15; 2 Corinthians 4:6; Luke 10:27; Galatians 3:11; and Revelation 22:12. No doubt Adam and Eve made these important rules a part of their children’s education. What do these verses teach?`

“God made the earth. At that time, God gave humans a plan for education. God wanted this plan to be an example for humans for the future too. So, God started a school in Eden. Eden was the home of our first parents. The school in Eden showed God’s important rules about education. The Garden of Eden itself was the schoolroom.”—Ellen G. White, page 20, adapted.

Christian education involves teaching families and their members about Bible teachings, worship, skills, friendship, sharing the Good News about Jesus, and serving God. Home is where you show family members God’s love and teach them about His promises. Home is where parents first tell their children about Jesus. Parents show their children that Jesus is their Savior and friend. The parents also teach their kids that the Bible is God’s Word. Family is where parents show their children how to be close to their Father in heaven.

In Genesis 4:1–4, we see Cain and Abel bring their offerings to the Lord. We can be sure that Cain and Abel learned why these offerings are important to God’s saving plan. Of course, as the story shows, a good education doesn’t always keep bad things from happening.

`What choices can you make in your home to make sure that truth is taught and lived out there?`
