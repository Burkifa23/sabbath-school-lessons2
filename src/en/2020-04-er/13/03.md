`“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death, sadness [being sad], crying, or pain. All the old ways are gone” (Revelation 21:4, ERV). What does this verse tell us about our new life in heaven? What will happen to death, sorrow, and pain? How different from this old life will our new life be?`

A Christian talked to a friend about the promise of everlasting life in Jesus Christ. The friend answered, “Everlasting life? What an awful thought! Our 70-80 years here are bad enough. Who wants to continue this life forever? That will be hell.”

This person didn’t understand the promise of everlasting life. It is not this life continuing forever. Who wants that? As Revelation 21:4 shows us, the old things end. All things become new.

**What do the verses below tell us about the new life that is coming?**

`2 Peter 3:10–13`

`Revelation 21:1–6`

`The important question for each and every one of us is: What does it take for us to become part of this new life? How do we get there? How can we be sure we will be part of it? What things in our life can stand in the way of our being part of what God promised us in Jesus?`
