  title: "Christian Education. Easy Reading"
  description: "“Wisdom begins with fear and respect for the LORD. Knowledge of the Holy One leads to understanding” (Proverbs 9:10, ERV). Think about the verse above. It talks about two ideas that are closely joined to each other: (1) “fear,” which is “wonder.” This is the wonder we feel when we think about the glory and power of God. And (2) “knowledge,” which is the same as learning truth about God’s love and what is in His heart. So, wisdom, knowledge, and understanding start with God Himself."
