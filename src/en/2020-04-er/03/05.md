When we obey God’s law, we will enjoy many wonderful blessings. The Bible shows us that God blesses people who obey Him. Again and again, the Lord tells His people Israel that if they obey His law, they will have success. Joshua is a good example of success. Joshua carefully obeys God’s law. God blesses Joshua with strong leadership skills. As we see, Joshua is a good leader.

`Read 2 Chronicles 31:20, 21. As these verses show, why did Hezekiah have success?`

As teachers, we must show our students that obedience to God is an important part of their success in life. But our students are not stupid. They will see, sooner or later, the truth. Some people who obey God suffer awful things in life. How do we explain this?

The truth is, we can’t. We live on an earth ruined by sin and evil. Everyone living on this earth is in the middle of the worldwide war between good and evil. No one can escape being hurt by it.

`Read Mark 6:25–27; Job 1; Job 2; 2 Corinthians 11:23–29. What do these verses teach us about why bad things happen to good people who love and obey God?`

For sure, good and loyal people who love God have not always enjoyed success in this life. On the outside, they do not have what many people say is success. What exactly do we mean by “success”? This question is important as we try to teach our children and students why they should obey God’s law. Let’s see what the psalmist has to say. “One day in your Temple is better than a thousand days anywhere else. Serving as a guard at the gate of my God’s house is better than living in the homes of the wicked” (Psalm 84:10, ERV). In the eyes of most people, people who obey God don’t always have “success.” At least, not now. It won’t do any good to tell our students that obedience always leads to success.

`Read Hebrews 11:13–16. How do these verses help us understand why people who obey God suffer in this life?`
