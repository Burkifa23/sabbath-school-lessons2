The Bible teaches that God made the earth in six days. This Bible teaching is very important to our faith. But this is not the only important teaching. Often, we see this teaching connected with the teaching about God’s plan to save sinners. That’s because we live on a planet filled with sin and death. So, the Bible teaching about God as the One who made everything is not enough. We live, suffer, and then what happens? We die. We end up no different from a dead animal on the side of the road.

How wonderful is that?

Not very. So, the teaching about a Savior is very important to our Christian worldview. As you will remember, a worldview is the way we look at life and understand it. And Jesus Christ, His death on the cross, and His waking up from the dead are very important to everything we believe.

`Read John 1:1–14. What do these verses tell us about who Jesus was and what He did for us?`

Look also at the first angel’s message: “Then I saw another angel flying high in the air. The angel had the eternal [everlasting] Good News to announce to the people living on earth—to every nation [country], tribe [family group], language, and race [group] of people. The angel said in a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give him praise. The time has come for God to judge all people. Worship God. He made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the springs [places where water comes out of the earth] of water’ ” (Revelation 14:6, 7, ERV). Do you see that the “eternal [everlasting] Good News” is connected to God as the One who made everything? This same God took our place on the cross. He was punished for our sins. No wonder we must worship Him!

Jesus and the cross must be the center of everything we teach. This teaching about Jesus must also include the Second Coming too. Jesus’ first coming doesn’t really do us a whole lot of good without the Second Coming, right? Jesus’ first and second comings are two parts of one plan: God’s plan to save sinners from sin and death.

`Think more about the idea in John 1: God who made everything is the One who died on the cross for us. Why should we worship Him because of this?`
