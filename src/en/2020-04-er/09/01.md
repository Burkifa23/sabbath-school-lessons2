### Read for This Week’s Study

> <p>Memory Text</p>
> “ We were not looking for praise from you or anyone else. We are apostles of Christ. When we were with you, we could have used our authority to make you do things. But we were very gentle with you. We were like a mother caring for her little children. Because we loved you, we were happy to share God’s Good News with you. But not only that, we were also happy to share even our own lives with you” (1 Thessalonians 2:6-8, ICB).

THE BIBLE SHOWS US people who wish to know God with all their hearts. They want to understand His plan for their lives. The Bible also shows us again and again that the church is a place where people can talk about important topics. The church is also a place where people can grow in their knowledge of God and His plan for their lives.

Sometimes we are afraid to ask questions. But we should not be. The Bible shows us that people ask questions to understand God better. In the same way, people tell stories in the Bible to help each other think about what is important. Jesus used a lot of stories to teach Bible truth to His followers.

The church is a place where we learn. So, it also must be a place where real conversation can happen. We must make the church a safe place for each person to grow and understand God and His plan for their lives.
