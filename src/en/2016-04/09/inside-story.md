### The Devil’s Lies: Part 2

Rui began reading the Bible on his own. In this way, he discovered references to the Sabbath day.

Rui knew that the Sabbath was Saturday, for the words are the same in Portuguese. But he didn’t know of a church that worshiped on Saturday. Then a few weeks later, Rui heard a radio program during which the speaker offered free Bible studies. He enrolled and began studying the lessons.

Almost immediately, Rui began finding answers to the questions that had troubled him for so many years. But before he made a decision about what he was learning, Rui’s study was interrupted when he met a young woman. Rui put aside the Bible studies and spent his time with his beloved. Eventually the couple married. At last, he felt fulfillment in his life.

But whenever the couple attended church, Rui felt the old conflicts arising in his heart. He no longer believed that Sunday was the biblical day of worship, and he now understood that the dead are asleep, not alive in some other place. These religious tensions spilled out into his family life, causing unrest and arguments. Rui feared that if he followed his convictions, his marriage might be over.

Rui learned that his wife’s cousin was a Seventh-day Adventist and that the Bible studies he had taken were sponsored by Adventists. Suddenly, the questions he had asked all his life had answers. Everything fell into place. But still he faced a dilemma: What would his wife say if she knew of his interest in this church?

Rui began watching an Adventist television network while his wife wasn’t home. When she went to visit her parents for several weeks, Rui attended the Adventist church. He found a spiritual home and was convinced that this was where God wanted him to be.

Rui struggled to tell his wife, and when he finally told her, she didn’t take his religious fervor seriously. She had seen him struggle spiritually since they had met. But Rui knew that he had found what he was looking for. He studied further and then asked to be baptized. “I’m at peace,” he says. “The devil’s lies no longer plague me, for I have found the truth.”
