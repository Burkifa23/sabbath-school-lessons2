### The Conversion of a Convict. Part 2

Alexandru went to Norway, where he began drug dealing. He was nearly killed twice and thought it was Satan’s power that made him invincible.

Eventually, he was arrested for drug trafficking and sent back to Romania, where he bought and sold illegal guns. His father-in-law was so angry that he called the police.

Alexandru was imprisoned for two years. Prison officials were desperate to know what to do with this man. In one final attempt to reform him, they put Alexandru in charge of the prison’s social activities room. As part of his job, Alexandru had to attend all meetings.

Church services were held there, including Seventh-day Adventist meetings conducted by lay evangelists. Alexandru enjoyed confounding the speakers with difficult questions. He even read the Bible to find questions to baffle these humble men.

But fighting against religion meant he heard a lot of sermons, and asking questions meant he received a lot of answers. Gradually, Alexandru learned about God’s love. During one meeting, the lay evangelist asked Alexandru to pray. His mind was in turmoil, and he found it difficult to pray.

After the meeting, the lay evangelist touched Alexandru and said, “You aren’t far from the kingdom of God.” Deeply moved, Alexandru began studying the Bible earnestly, looking for faith and comfort rather than for questions to con- found the speaker. He realized that he now believed in God.

Prisoners and guards noticed the change in Alexandru. He started treating prisoners with kindness and the guards with respect. When his friends men- tioned the change, Alexandru told them God made the difference.

Alexandru asked the lay evangelist to notify his family in Bucharest about the change in his life. His wife was astonished. She found it difficult to believe that her infamous husband could change so drastically. During the last months of his imprisonment, Alexandru became a teacher among fellow prisoners.

After Alexandru was released, he and his wife, Florentina, spent hours in serious discussion and Bible study. Step by step, he showed her the beautiful message of God’s love and salvation. Little by little, she came to understand the power that had changed her husband from a hardened criminal to a gentle, kind, loving man of God.

The months following Alexandru’s release from prison were difficult. His friends from the underground pressured him to re-enter the lucrative world of ill-gotten fortune. But he stood firm.

Later, Alexandru and Florentina were baptized together in the church near the prison where he was converted.
