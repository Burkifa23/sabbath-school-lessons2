#### Doing God’s Business: Part 1

This story is not about me. It’s about what God is doing through me and what He can do through anyone who’s willing to let Him use them.

I’ve always loved business. I founded my first company selling computers to schools when I was 21. From the beginning God was my partner, and He has blessed me so much.

Later, I bought a software franchise that grew fast. In five years, it grew from one employee to 50 and earned a lot of money. I gave a lot to missions, but I felt empty. Over time I realized that although I was supporting the church’s mission, I wasn’t personally involved in mission. My wife and I agreed that we needed to be a part of God’s outreach to humanity.

Our business interests continued to grow, but I felt God leading me to sell the biggest company. I left the sale in God’s hands, and the company sold quickly for more than I had expected.

I knew that God doesn’t need my money, but I began to realize that what God wants from me is my time. Mission isn’t something we do on Sabbath. It’s something we do full-time. I wanted to be personally involved in mission. So, I asked God what He wanted me to do for Him.

One day as I was talking with a fellow Christian businessman, a member of Adventist-laymen’s Services and Industries (ASI), I told him about my burden to be personally involved in an evangelistic mission project. I didn’t care where the project was, I just wanted to be God’s hands. I asked him if he had any ideas for such a project. He said that he’d think about it.

Just then his phone rang, and he excused himself to take the call. When he returned, he told me that the call was from a church leader who told him about a project that’s in a country that isn’t open to evangelism.

As he told me about the project, I realized that God was answering my prayer! The project was in a country I was familiar with. I knew the language and the culture of the people in that country, and as a businessman I could help the church leaders make it happen. I knew that I could travel there, a place that many others wouldn’t be able to enter.
