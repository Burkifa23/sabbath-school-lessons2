#### Further Thought

“ ‘Now is the judgment of this world,’ Christ continued; ‘now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all unto Me. This He said, signifying what death He should die.’ This is the crisis of the world. If I become the propitiation for the sins of men, the world will be lighted up. Satan’s hold upon the souls of men will be broken. The defaced image of God will be restored in humanity, and a family of believing saints will finally inherit the heavenly home. This is the result of Christ’s death. The Saviour is lost in contemplation of the scene of triumph called up before Him. He sees the cross, the cruel, ignominious cross, with all its attending horrors, blazing with glory. 

“But the work of human redemption is not all that is accomplished by the cross. The love of God is manifested to the universe. The prince of this world is cast out. The accusations which Satan has brought against God are refuted. The reproach which he has cast upon heaven is forever removed. Angels as well as men are drawn to the Redeemer.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 625, 626.

#### Discussion Questions:

- `What are other ways that you can think of regarding how the life and death of Jesus answered questions that the book of Job left unanswered?`

- `Think over what the Cross reveals to us about the character of God, especially when we realize that the One who created us was the One who died for us on the cross. Why should this reality give us so much hope and comfort, regardless of whatever trials we are facing? How can this amazing truth teach us to trust in God and in His goodness? (See Rom. 8:32.)`

- `As we saw, the book of Job showed, among other things, that the great controversy is a cosmic issue and that the conflict between Christ and Satan has a dimension that goes beyond the earth itself. Imagine what it must have been like for heavenly creatures, who knew Jesus only in His heavenly glory, to see Him go through what He did on the cross. How can dwelling on this amazing idea help us to come to a great appreciation of what we have been given in Jesus?`
