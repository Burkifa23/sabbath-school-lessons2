### The Character of Job

### Read for This Week’s Study
Job 1:1, 8; Job 29:8–17; Job 31:1–23; Exod. 20:17; Matt. 7:22–27; Matt. 5:16; Eph. 3:10.

> <p>Memory Text:</p>
> “Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect?” (James 2:22, NKJV). 

In the midst of all the major issues touched on in the book of Job, we mustn’t lose sight of another crucial theme: that of Job himself. Who was this man whom the Lord trusted so much that He challenged the devil over his faithfulness and integrity? Who was this man who did not understand why all this was happening to him, who knew that what was happening to him wasn’t fair, who expressed anger and frustration over it all, and yet stayed faithful right through to the end?

While the essence of the book of Job dealt with Job after the calamities struck, from this story we can pick up information about Job’s earlier life. And what we learn about Job’s past and the kind of man he was gives us a greater understanding of why Job stayed faithful to the Lord, even amid all the terrible suffering, even amid everything Satan did to try to turn him away from God.

What was Job like, and what can we learn about how he lived that can help to make us be more faithful followers of the Lord as we live our own lives?
