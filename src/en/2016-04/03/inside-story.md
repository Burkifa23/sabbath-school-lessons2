### Filling the Emptiness: Part 1

As the youngest child in a Romanian family and the only daughter, Elena was showered with love. Yet she felt an emptiness deep inside, but she didn’t know what it was. Her friends invited her to join them at the disco, where she could fill her emptiness with music and danc- ing, but her parents forbade her to go.

One of Elena’s friends invited her to visit the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Elena had heard that Adventists were good and honest peo- ple. But her grandmother warned her that faithful Orthodox members don’t go inside of Protestant churches. So Elena didn’t go.

Then someone invited Elena to attend a Week of Prayer series. These meetings aren’t regular worship services, she reasoned, so there can be no harm in going. Her father gave her permission to go, so she went, partly out of curiosity about what other churches teach. She attended every meeting and learned that Jesus wants to be her personal Friend, that He loves her, died for her, and is coming again. For the first time in her life, Elena felt happiness. She wanted to hear more and decided to attend the church on Saturday.

When Elena’s father realized that she wanted to attend worship services on Sabbath, he was angry. But Elena had tasted the love of Christ and knew that she must learn more. However, when she tried to leave home to go to the church, her father stopped her. “This fam- ily has only one religion,” he said. “No one in this house will bring in any other religion.”

But as Elena read her Bible and learned other truths she hadn’t known, she decided that Saturday is God’s Sabbath. She wanted to attend church, but she knew her parents wouldn’t allow her to go. So she told them that she was going to visit her grandmother. On her way to church she stopped in at her grandmother’s for a few minutes but then went on to church. Her grandmother knew what Elena was doing and warned her that it would bring sadness to the family.

A widow lived next door to Elena’s family. She had heard of Elena’s desire to attend church. She invited Elena to come to her house on Friday afternoons so she could slip off to church for the evening vespers program. Elena was careful to leave church early, so she wouldn’t be seen walking with Adventists.
