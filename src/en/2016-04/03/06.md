Job 1:22 reads, “In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong” (NKJV). Job 2:10 reads, “In all this Job did not sin with his lips” (NKJV). In both cases, despite the attacks, Job stayed faithful to the Lord. Both texts stress the fact that Job did not sin, either with actions or with words.

Of course, the texts don’t say that Job wasn’t a sinner. They would never say that, because the Bible teaches that we are all sinners. “If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us” (1 John 1:10, NKJV). Being “blameless and upright,” fearing God and shunning evil (Job 1:1, NKJV), does not make a person sinless. Like everyone else, Job was born in sin and needed a Savior.

Nevertheless, despite all that came upon him, he remained faithful to the Lord. In this sense, in his own way Job could be seen as a kind of symbol, a faint example of Jesus (see lesson 14), who, amid ter- rible trials and temptations, didn’t give up, didn’t fall into sin, and thus refuted Satan’s charges against God. Of course, what Christ did was so much bigger, grander, and more consequential than what Job did. Nevertheless, the simple parallel remains.

```Read Matthew 4:1–11. How did Job’s experience reflect what hap- pened here?``

Though in a terrible environment, His body weakened by lack of food, Jesus in His humanity, in “the likeness of sinful flesh” (Rom. 8:3), did not do what the devil wanted Him to do, just as Job didn’t either. And also just as Satan disappeared from the scene after Job stayed faithful, after Jesus resisted Satan’s last effort against Him, Scripture said that “the devil left Him” (Matt. 4:11, NKJV; see also James 4:7).

Yet, what Jesus faced in the wilderness was only the start. His real test would come at the cross, and here, too, despite everything thrown at Him (even worse than what Job faced), Jesus stayed faithful, even unto death.
