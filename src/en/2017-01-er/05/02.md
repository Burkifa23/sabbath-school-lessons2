### THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

(Mark 1:8)

`Read Mark 1:8. (Compare this verse with Matthew 3:11; Luke 3:16; and John 1:33.) Also read Acts 1:5 and Acts 11:16. According to these verses, what other important act happens along with the baptism of the Spirit?` 

In the New Testament, there are only seven verses that speak about being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Four of the verses refer to John the Baptist and point to Pentecost. At Pentecost, Christ gave the Holy Spirit to His followers. The gift marked the beginning of “the last days” of salvation history. 

The four Gospels talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But the Gospel (book) of John does not describe this baptism in the same way that the Gospel books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke do. For example, John does not speak about the baptism of the Spirit as something that happens only in the future. Instead, he makes it clear that the baptism of the Spirit is an ongoing experience. It has continuing power in the life of the believer (read John 1:33). 

In the same way, John talks about another important work of Jesus a few verses earlier in John 1:29. This work of Jesus involves taking away our sins and giving us the Holy Spirit. Both of these experiences happen in Acts 2:38. The disciples’ eyes are opened to Christ. Then they receive both forgiveness of sins and the Holy Spirit. Acts 10:43, 44 says that the same experience happens to believers in the house of Cornelius.  

In the New Testament, receiving the Holy Spirit goes together with baptism. Both point to our new birth. This is because in baptism we become Christ’s. Why does Jesus give us the Holy Spirit? He wants us to live in His power. And He wants us to share the good news with others. The good news is that He takes away our sins. 

All believers, then, are meant to drink of the Spirit. In 1 Corinthians 12:13, Paul says that we all are baptized by the Spirit into one body (church) of believers. He talks about the importance of all believers becoming one in heart and in mind. The word all is important. Paul connects the oneness in Christ of all believers with the baptism of the Spirit. 

`What has been your own experience in being baptized (filled) by the Holy Spirit? What has He meant to your life? What would you be like without Him working in you?`
