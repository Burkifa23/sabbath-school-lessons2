#### Something Beautiful: Part 1

Editor’s Note: In the following three-part story, Kim Laovin from Stockholm, Sweden, tells how God transformed her life of misery into something beautiful. 

For 25 years, more than half my life, the first thing I did every morning was inject heroin into my veins. I used heroin to get through the day. Then one July morning I awoke and knew that I was done letting drugs run my life. I knew I would get sick if I stopped taking drugs, but I was determined to get clean. 

Drugs were not only my life—they were my livelihood. I had a lovely big house, owned a good car, and had lots of nice clothes. But when I gave up drugs, the beautiful things around me seemed filthy and disgusting. They had been purchased with drug money. I sold or gave away everything. Then with only a suitcase of things left, I moved to another town. 

I suffered all the symptoms of withdrawal, but I refused to go back on drugs. I knew if I could only tough it out long enough, I would feel better. Weeks went by, and I was still very weak and tired. My chest hurt, and I could not walk more than a block.

I went to the doctor, and after he examined me, he declared, “You have a serious heart problem. Your heart is enlarged and is working hard, but it is doing only half the work it should. The pain you feel is angina. It is pain caused when the heart does not get enough oxygen.”  I realized that, ironically, the drugs I had been taking had masked these symptoms for years.

The doctor gave me medicine and sent me home. But I had no real home to go back to. I had been staying with a friend, but my friend could not keep me forever. I was sick, lonely, and homeless. I started calling my relatives. They were happy to hear from me and happy to hear I was no longer taking drugs, but they had reasons why I could not come and stay with them. Finally, an uncle took me in. He and my aunt were kind and took me to see a nearby doctor.

“Have you taken the medicine you were prescribed?” the doctor asked.

“No,” I admitted. “I have just kicked a drug addiction, and I don’t want to become addicted to these drugs.”
