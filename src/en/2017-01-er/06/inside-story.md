#### “Lord, I Can’t Find You. Please Find Me”: Part 2

Greg invited Hannele to visit an Adventist church. She hesitated because she had been disappointed so often, but eventually she agreed to go. She didn’t expect much; but when she arrived at the church, she was overwhelmed by the warmth and friendliness of the people. She was amazed to hear the deep Bible discussion. “These people knew so much about the Bible! I loved the sermon too,” Hannele later recalled. “I returned the following week.” 

At first, Hannele struggled with attending church on Saturday until she understood the preciousness of the Sabbath. Several other aspects of the Adventist faith puzzled her as well, but Greg helped her to find answers to her questions, and she continued attending the church. 

“I fell in love with Jesus, just as my cousin had done so many years earlier,” said Hannele. “That summer I visited the church’s Bible camp, where I studied the Bible deeply with fellow seekers and came away spiritually refreshed. During breaks, I sat by the lake and prayed for my husband.” 

Hannele returned home from camp rejoicing. As usual, she shared her love for God with her husband, but this time she felt compelled to urge him to make a decision for Jesus. She didn’t know it then, but that was their last conversation about religion. Two days later he died in an automobile accident. 

“I couldn’t understand why God would take away my husband so soon after I had given my life to the Lord,” she said. “Now I understand that God gave me a church family to support me and pray with me during those difficult days. The Bible texts I had memorized gave me peace, and the Holy Spirit comforted me.” 

Hannele went to work for the church’s Bible correspondence school, where she helps others who are struggling with some of the same issues she had. Eventually, Hannele met a good man at church, and the two married. “God has given us a ministry together,” she says. 

As for Greg in Australia, he returned to the Lord as well. God surely works in mysterious ways!
