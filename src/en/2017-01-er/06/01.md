### The Holy Spirit and Living a Holy Life

### READ FOR THIS WEEK’S LESSON
1 Peter 1:14–16; Isaiah 6:3; Hebrews 12:14; 1 Corinthians 6:11; 1 Timothy 1:8; Psalm 15:1, 2.

> <p>MEMORY VERSE</p>
> “God is the God who gives peace. May he make you holy through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept free from blame. May you be without blame from now until our Lord Jesus Christ comes” (1 Thessalonians 5:23, NIrV).

IT IS VERY EASY for our hearts to grow hard against the holiness of God. It is just as easy to forget how much God hates sin and evil. 

But holiness is an important theme in the Bible. The pursuit of living a holy life should be a goal for every Christian. We also should wish to be as loving and pure as Jesus. 

God’s love and His holiness belong together. They cannot be separated. Without God’s holiness, His love would just be a feeling. Without His love, God’s holiness would seem stern and unfriendly. Together, both God’s love and His holiness are the most basic parts of who He is. 

So, the Holy Spirit is deeply connected with our pursuit of a holy life. After all, His name is Holy Spirit. And He is called “the Spirit of holiness” (Romans 1:4, NKJV). His name, then, reminds us that God is holy. His name reminds us that it is God’s great desire to make sinners holy.

This week we will look closer at what it means to be holy and to live a holy life.
