#### Finding God’s Plan: Part 1

“Roza, take a look at this,” Grandmother said as she gave Roza a colorful pamphlet. “It’s an invitation to a series of lectures about the Bible. You should go. You might learn something interesting.”

Grandmother knew that Roza, who was preparing to become a teacher, was interested in religious things. She was active in her parents’ church in Poland and even volunteered as a youth leader, though she wasn’t much older than the youth she led. Her parents were proud of her involvement with the church and of her other accomplishments. 

Roza took the pamphlet from her grandmother and looked closely at the colorful pictures on the front. She read the invitation and decided to attend the lectures. She was curious about what she might learn.

Roza found a seat and settled down for the lecture. She met a young man at the lectures who was about her age. As they became acquainted, he invited her to attend a summer Bible camp that the church sponsored. Roza decided to go; she was curious about this church that seemed to know so much about the Bible.

When she arrived at the Seventh-day Adventist youth camp, Roza was a bit nervous about being among so many strangers. But the young man who had invited her introduced her to several young people from her hometown. She liked making new friends and soon found herself enjoying the fellowship at the Bible camp as much as she did the Bible studies.

When Roza returned home, she started attending the Adventist church every Sabbath. She knew that her parents wouldn’t be happy that she was attending a new church, so she didn’t tell them where she was going on Sabbath mornings.

But soon her excitement about what she was learning spilled over, and she told her mother everything she had learned at Bible camp and church. She told her mother that smoking was not healthy and urged her to quit. Roza also explained what she had learned about having a personal relationship with Jesus. “We don’t have to confess our sins to a priest,” she told her mother. “Just tell God.”

Roza’s revelation worried her mother. “Why do you want to get involved in some strange church?” she asked. “We have a perfectly good church.”

“But these people really love Jesus,” Roza explained. “They follow the Bible. I want to learn what God teaches.”

“If you insist on becoming an Adventist,” her mother said with a sigh, “don’t expect any financial support from me.”
