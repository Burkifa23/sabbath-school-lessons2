#### The Newspaper Ad: Part 1

Kim leafed through the newspaper, scanning the headlines and reading the stories that caught his interest. His eyes fell on a small advertisement in the lower corner of the page. He read it absently, then stopped and read it again. He turned the page and continued reading, but his mind returned to that small advertisement. The few sentences in the advertisement invited readers to join a Bible study that was meeting on Tuesday evenings. 

Kim flipped back through the newspaper, drawn to the ad as a moth is drawn to a flame. He read the ad again, sensing that it offered something that he needed, that he had been searching for.

Kim had always been interested in spiritual things. Although his family, like most in Denmark, wasn’t religious, Kim always believed in good, if not in God. Kim sensed that life was filled with struggles between good and evil. He had seen evil in the alcohol and drugs and violence that he’d encountered, and he reasoned that if evil existed, then somewhere good must exist as well. 

He tried to live a good life, but his failures frustrated him. He searched for ways to embrace goodness without realizing that the good he was looking for was God. 

In his search for goodness, Kim adopted a healthy lifestyle and became a vegetarian. He shared what he was learning with his family, but he was careful not to overwhelm them with too much information. Over the course of time his parents saw the wisdom in his healthy lifestyle. 

As he read books on health, he was introduced to the New Age movement. New Age teachings don’t deny God; instead, they teach that God exists within every person as a force for good. But salvation through Jesus Christ isn’t a part of New Age teachings. 

When Kim faced some personal problems, he realized that the New Age movement didn’t hold all the answers. There had to be something more to life that he hadn’t yet discovered. He began to question God. Was He real? Did He care about humanity? Could He love a person and help him or her in times of trouble? If God cared about him, Kim wanted to meet Him.
