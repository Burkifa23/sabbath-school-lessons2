#### From Mafia Men to God’s Messengers: Part 2

Every week, Igor brought his gun to church, keeping it securely on his lap. One Sabbath, a church member told him that he shouldn’t bring his gun. “Let your hold be on God, not guns,” he said.

The following week, Igor left his gun at home, but he found it difficult to come to terms with being unarmed. Returning home, he saw a dark silhouette following him. Deciding not to be afraid, Igor turned toward the silhouette—only to find a man carrying a sack of potatoes!

As his faith grew, Igor told others about the truth he had found. Igor’s wife and sister started visiting the Seventh-day Adventist church, and after a year they were baptized. His niece and nephew also came to church—and many more with whom he had shared his faith.

One day, Igor was sharing with a friend things he had learned from the Bible, but the friend wasn’t interested. However, a man standing nearby was listening and wanted to learn more.

Vasily, who had been eavesdropping on Igor’s conversation, had been living a very hard life. He was involved with the mafia, and crime had taken its toll. Scars and disfigurement marked where enemies had used broken glass to cut deep gashes all over his head, face, eyes, and an ear. Other scars showed where bullets had grazed his scalp without inflicting fatal wounds.

Vasily was involved with big money. He worked in a company that created contracts worth millions of Russian rubles. Trained as a bodyguard, Vasily spoke with company leadership in code. He had expensive equipment that allowed him to eavesdrop into closed rooms. People who wanted to ruin this company recognized that Vasily was a key player in winning the big contracts, and because he was an obstacle, they tried to kill him—twice.

The first time was when he went to the outdoor market with his daughter. Although viciously attacked, he survived.

During the second attempt, Vasily was shot multiple times. Running to his apartment, he collapsed on the floor. Fearing he was about to die, he begged his mother to forgive him, but she assured him that he was going to live. With renewed hope, Vasily began fighting for his life. He was quickly taken to the hospital where he received treatment and was eventually released.

One day, Vasily met a Baptist man who asked him, “Do you want to kill the guys who did this to you?”

“Of course!” Vasily replied.

“Don’t do it,” the man said. “Forgive them. If you kill them, you can never live peacefully.”
