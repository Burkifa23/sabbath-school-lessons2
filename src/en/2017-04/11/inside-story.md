#### From Cigarettes to Castles: Part 3

Whenever I have difficulties in life, God reminds me of the first steps of faith—to pray and rely on Him.

I’m now a small-business owner. I sell toys, and I have some bounce castles that are set up in various parks around the city of Vinnytsia. Every client who comes to our business receives a free Seventh-day Adventist magazine filled with good health and spiritual information.

The most popular days for people to go to the park are Saturday and Sunday. The central city park belongs to the city administration, so when my business does well, they receive a good percentage. But the challenge is that I don’t work on Saturdays. In the beginning, we had some challenges with the city over that. They tried to force me to be there, but

I was firm—either I don’t work on Saturday, or I don’t work at all. They could see that I was firm, and they could see that we worked properly. They appreciate our work and know that we are people of principle.

Sometimes I visit the cemetery where my mom is buried. As I walk past the graves, I see the names of my friends buried there. I’m especially sad when I see three names, because when I became a Christian, I talked with those guys. I invited them to come to church and to follow the path that I had taken, but now their names are at the cemetery.

The last time I was home, my wife was given the opportunity to see how horrendous my former life was. As we were walking, we saw some of my old friends who are still alive sitting on a bench. When one of my old friends saw me, he ran to me, fell on his knees, and started crying, saying, “I’m tired of the life I’m living!”

I told him that not long ago, on that very spot, I had told our friend, who was now in the grave, to go to church. And now I was telling him, “Go to church!” but he wouldn’t listen to me either.

He said, “I’m going to have the same fate as the guy in the grave.”

I pleaded with him, “It’s much easier to go to church than to the cemetery. Look at me now—here are my wife and children.”

He looked at them. “You can start a new life,” I assured him. But he just turned back to his friends, back to drinking. He didn’t have a family. He didn’t have anything. He just spent every day looking for another bottle of booze.

As we walked away, my wife whispered, “Now I see what you used to be in the past.”

“Yes,” I whispered back, “and I was the worst one of them all.”
