#### From Cigarettes to Castles: Part 1

I grew up in a secular Ukrainian home. My father said that the world would end in the year 2000, and I was certain there was no hope for the future.

Since my parents seemed always to be giving more attention to my sisters, I felt free to do whatever I wanted to do. From a young age, I was constantly smoking, drinking, and trying drugs. Life for my parents became very hard, as I started stealing within the family and outside. My parents became deeply concerned.

When I was away for military service, a Seventh-day Adventist evangelistic series came to our city, and my father was baptized. After returning home, I started living an even more intensely wild life. My mother became so ill with rheumatoid arthritis that she became an invalid, and my parents’ lives became a nightmare because of me.

My father asked the church to fast and pray. I could even hear my mother, who wasn’t a church member, praying for me in another room. Since the church didn’t have a place of its own, members often gathered at my house. During the service, I would leave.

But slowly, my interest was awakened.A group of young people—literature evangelists (LEs)—came to our city to distribute Adventist books, and my father invited me to meet them. There were hardly any young people in my father’s church, and I thought that only old or sickly people who didn’t have any purpose attended the church.

Nevertheless, I felt some sort of emptiness within my heart, so I decided to meet these young people. I imagined that they would be strange, sickly, or lacking something. But when I met them, I saw nice, strong, healthy-looking young people who were smiling. I saw happiness in their eyes. I heard cleanliness of speech. Suddenly I realized, It isn’t them who aren’t fitting in—it’s me.

I clearly could see two groups of young people in my mind: (1) my old friends, who were always cursing, drinking, and smoking; and (2) this group, that was pure and honest, that didn’t curse or swear, and that didn’t drink. I could say only positive things about them.

The LEs invited me to distribute literature with them, even though I had cigarettes in my pocket! They teamed me up with a responsible man, and when we went door to door, I sometimes walked away to smoke and wouldn’t open my mouth because I didn’t want anyone to smell the cigarettes.

I started coming to church. Sometimes my new friends invited me to youth meetings in other cities, and as my vision broadened, the warped picture I had in my mind was completely destroyed.
