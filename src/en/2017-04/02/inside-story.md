#### One Year in Mission: Part 1

Anna was certain that God led her to study at Saratov State University, located beside the famous Volga River in Russia. Now she was graduating with a degree in biology, but as she searched for a job, nothing could be found.

“God,” she prayed, “I don’t know why I can’t find a job. But I know You provided this education and that You have something in mind for me.”

God did have plans forAnna—much bigger than she imagined. One day, the youth director of the Volga Conference asked Anna if she would be interested in serving in the One Year in Mission (OYIM) program, a special General Conference initiative to give young adults opportunities to participate in the Mission to the Cities outreach.

“Yes, I really want to do something for God,” Anna responded.

She soon learned that she was chosen to represent the Euro-Asia Division in the OYIM program launching in NewYork City in 2013.Anna arrived in New York on January 24, 2013, and immediately joined the 13 other young adults representing all divisions and attached fields of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

The young people received leadership training in community service, evangelism, medical missionary work, and communication. After New York, they took their practical experience and training back to their divisions and trained a team of ten volunteers coming from each union of their division. In this way, the missionary effect would multiply.

“We used Christ’s method alone—mingling with people, understanding their needs, giving Bible studies, and inviting them to follow Jesus,” Anna said.

Every day, the OYIM missionaries knocked on doors. “Hello, we’ve recently moved here and just wanted to greet you. We’re your new neighbors,” they said. Most of those visited were from India or Nepal, and some invited the missionaries in for a chat.

“When we talked together, they became our friends,”Anna said. “We asked if they wanted to study the Bible, and many agreed. Often we prayed with them.”

“Sometimes I made blinis [thin Russian pancakes] and delivered them to the neighbors, telling them I just wanted to let them know God loves them.”

In addition to her neighborhood activities, Anna was assigned to work in an Adventist church located in a Spanish-speaking community. Many of the residents wanted to learn English, so Anna and others started free English classes at the Adventist church.

“People were so happy,” Anna says. “We began every lesson with a Bible verse, explaining the grammar and the meaning of the verse.After the lessons, we invited them to come to the evening evangelistic programs. We made many contacts this way!”
