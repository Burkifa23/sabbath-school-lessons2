### The Lesson in Brief

**Key Text**: Romans 6:1–4

**The Student Will**:

- **Know**: Believe that sin’s mastery is broken and death is defeated for all believers who identify with Christ’s death and resurrection.
- **Feel**: Rejoice that God has not left His children helpless when faced with sin’s power and penalty.
- **Do**: Live as one who has already been resurrected from the dead, with all of heaven anticipating his or her new life.

#### Learning Outline:

1. Know: Christ’s Experience Can Be Mine.
+ How can the twin historical facts of the death and resurrection of Christ be translated into our personal experience now?
+ What do Paul’s rhetorical questions in Romans 6:1 and Romans 6:15 tell us about any possible wrong conclusions his readers may come to with regard to a grace-filled life?

2. Feel: The Freedom of Obedience
+ How would you convince someone that being a servant of righteousness (Rom. 6:18) is the only path to true freedom?
+ Why can there be no third option between being “servants of God” (Rom. 6:22) and “servants of sin” (Rom. 6:20)?

3. Do: Live the New Life.
+ What does it say about the character of God and His plan of redemption when Christians allow sin to dominate their lives?
+ If a life of sanctification is filled with such joy, peace, and freedom, why is there often resistance to intentional holy living?

**Summary**: Christians have the privilege of rejoicing not only in forgiveness of their sin but in liberation from sin’s dominance in their lives.

#### Learning Cycle

##### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Romans 6:5–7, 12–14, 22

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus have brought about the long-anticipated, new era in which the twin enemies, sin and death, have been dealt a fatal blow. Because of this deathblow, sin’s dominance has been broken, and our obedience may be completely devoted to the risen Christ. Our persistent faith in Christ is necessary, however, because the old age (era) lingers on, and we sense in our struggle the “already” and “not yet” of salvation’s reality.

**Just for Teachers**: For some, the subject of “overcoming sin” is a thrilling idea. For others, it conjures up only a sense of failure and guilt. Sometimes the zeal of the first group is misdirected or misunderstood by the second group, and a hurtful controversy ensues. Therefore, it will be your privileged responsibility to carefully show how victory over sin is not a burden to be avoided but a blessed privilege to be embraced—a gift that is part and parcel of the grace of God.

**Opening Discussion**: Joseph’s business had been robbed. The day finally came when he found himself in a courtroom waiting for his case to be tried. As he waited, he had the opportunity to hear other cases. One woman’s pleas from the stand, in particular, moved him. She obviously had led a hard life and looked completely disheveled as she sat there. She was a repeat drug offender who was virtually begging the court to allow her into a Christian drug rehab program rather than to be sent back to jail again. She then broke into a testimony of how God had come into her life and saved her. However, the point she repeated again and again was that it wasn’t her works that had saved her but God’s grace.

Joseph listened with mixed feelings. Of course, the precious unmerited grace of God saves us all, and the gospel message must have been especially comforting to a person with a criminal record. However, there was no mention from her of God’s intentions or ability to aid her in her struggle with drugs, an angle that may have helped her case, seeing that she was seeking a Christian program for recovery. She ended up being refused.

**Questions for Discussion**:

1. Have we been so eager to tell people that “nothing they do” can earn heaven that we have failed to emphasize the rest of the story; namely, that God can help change “everything they do” for their own good and His glory?
2. If you had a few moments with the woman from the story, what might you share from Romans 6 that would impart to her some hope?

##### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: Issues of overcoming sin sometimes get co-opted into controversies over perfection and whether or not one particular hypothetical sin or another can keep you out of the kingdom. Raise the discussion onto a different plane by approaching it from Paul’s perspective in Romans 6 rather than from our internal squabbles.

**Bible Commentary**

**I. Newness of Life** (Review Romans 6:5–13 with your class.)

“Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body” (Rom. 6:12, NKJV). Is this imperative easier said than done? It may seem that Paul nonchalantly is telling his readers simply to avoid sin and instead serve God (Rom. 6:13). For those who take Paul’s advice seriously, we may feel that, as we reflect on our failures, we are not up to the task. The good news in all of this conundrum over sin is that Paul’s straightforward admonitions are couched in a most stupendous context. As this context is understood, his expectations of victory over sin can become realities in our lives.

So, what is this context? With the arrival of the death and resurrection of Christ, the continuum of history has made a seismic eschato-logical shift. Jesus referred to it when he said the “kingdom of God has come upon you” (Matt. 12:28, NKJV); Paul speaks of it when he talks about tasting the “powers of the age to come” (Heb. 6:5, NKJV). This new eon (age) that we live in has seen the outpouring of God’s Spirit in unprecedented ways (Acts 2) and the healing and spiritual restoration of those previously dominated by oppressive/demonic forces (Matt. 4:23; 12:22, 28; Luke 4:18; Acts 5:17). This new age of God’s ruling power is in the background when Paul speaks of our “old self ” being crucified with Christ so as to break sin’s slavery (Rom. 6:6, ESV). Our union with Christ in His resurrection then propels us into “newness of life” (Rom. 6:4, NKJV), which is no less than “the eschatological life of the age to come. Christians have been grasped by this life, and their lifewalk in this world is transformed by it.”—Ivan Blazen, Handbook of Seventh-Day Adventist Theology (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald Publishing Association, 2000), p. 296.

It is under this realization that we all live within the power of God’s kingdom. Thus the call to consider yourself “dead indeed to sin” (Rom. 6:11, NKJV)—not to let sin “reign” or “have . . . dominion over you” (Rom. 6:12, 14, ESV)—is not wishful idealism. These are imperatives rooted in the historical/salvational coming of our Lord; and therefore there is the real potential to live as “servants of righteousness,” not “servants of sin” (Rom. 6:17, 18).

**Consider This**: How does the knowledge that we now are living in a new eschatological age motivate us to refuse sin and live for God? How can this perspective guard us from (1) making excuses for sin in our lives and (2) forgetting that salvation is a gift?

**II. Law Versus Grace** (Review Romans 6:14 with your class.)

The contrast of not being “under the law” but “under grace” has been somewhat of a sticking point between Adventism and other Christian faiths, for obvious reasons. We’ve at least known what Romans 6:14 can’t mean, based on Paul’s emphatic rhetorical question: “Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!” (Rom. 6:15, ESV). So, it can’t mean to go on indiscriminately sinning. But what exactly does it mean? Invoking the concept of the “two ages,” as previously mentioned, may be helpful here, as well.

Considering the “old self ” experience (Rom. 6:6, ESV) as one of law and the “new self ” experience (Eph. 4:24, ESV) as one of grace yields some insights. Paul speaks of this triumvirate of LAW-SIN-DEATH repeatedly in Romans (Rom. 5:12, 13, 20, 21; 7:5, 9–11, 13, 23, 24; 8:2). It is likely that when he uses any three of them he may be speaking of the dynamic between all three of them. For example, Paul can speak of being “dead to sin” through the death of Christ just as easily as being “dead to the law” through Christ’s death (Rom. 6:2, 7:4, NKJV). The organic relationship between LAW-SINDEATH is so close that Paul at one point must emphasize that the law is not sin (Rom. 7:7). The trio is repeated as he climaxes his argument that in Christ Jesus we are “free from the law of sin and death” (Rom. 8:2).

So, the old self experience is one in which sin takes advantage of the law to produce death (Rom. 7:5, 8). It is dominated by the flesh so that though possessing the written code, lawbreaking is prevalent (Rom. 7:5, 6; 2:27). The experience of grace is made possible by the death and resurrection of Christ; it is filled with the Spirit, heart obedience to the law, and righteousness (Rom. 2:27–29; 6:4, 17–23; 7:6; 8:1–4). This angle may help us understand how Paul could say, “Sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace” (Rom. 6:14, ESV).

**Discussion Questions**:

1. How are we certain that being no longer “under the law” cannot translate into disobedience?
2. Using Romans, how would you explain that being “under grace” means that sin’s dominion is broken?

##### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Though the old-versus-new terminology is common within scholarship, it hasn’t carried over extensively into lay literature. To prevent misunderstanding and discouragement, reinforce the idea that though we live under “grace,” the “old self” still tempts and annoys through our “mortal” bodies.

**Application Questions**:

1. What verbs in Romans 6 show that we still have a responsibility of keeping within the “new self ” reality in which “grace reign[s] through righteousness” (Rom. 5:21)?
2. According to Romans 6, is being a slave of righteousness a burden or a privilege? Explain.

##### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: The secret of reading Paul is to think as much like Paul as possible. To achieve this, encourage the class to clear its mind of preconceptions during the following activity.

**Activity**: Paul often writes in contrasts.Take a whiteboard or piece of paper and make two headings: Old Self and New Self. From Romans 2–8, fill in events, experiences, or qualities that characterize each experience. (Alternatively, this exercise can be conducted as a discussion without the aid of supplies.)
