#### From Mafia Men to God’s Messengers: Part 3

One day, while walking in the forest, Vasily saw one of the men who had tried to kill him. Glancing at his potential killer, Vasily quietly breathed,

“OK, I will forgive him.”

Six months later, Vasily learned that the man had died of a drug overdose.

The second person who had tried to kill him became permanently disabled and the third was shot and killed.

As the new year drew near, Vasily geared up for the big parties that would take place—two weeks of drinking vodka and smoking.

But this year, it wasn’t the same. Vasily no longer enjoyed the partying. At the end of two weeks, he had had enough. "Was I born for such a dirty life?" he asked himself. The answer was a decided, No! I need a new life!

Falling to his knees, he prayed that God would help him. Somehow he was able to obtain a Bible, and with the Bible in hand, he went to each of his friends, inviting them to come with him to the forest for three days. Two friends decided to join him.

“We went to the forest, where we were quiet for three days, just reading the Bible,”Vasily said. He prayed, asking God to “give me one month to live this new life.” And He did. Then Vasily asked God for a second month of clean living, and it was given to him. He asked his wife for forgiveness, and by God’s grace, he is continuing to live a clean life.

When Vasily and Igor met, they realized that they had much in common. “In every place there are some people who like the truth,”Vasily said.

Vasily and Igor are now close friends who work together spreading truth through a special newspaper that is delivered throughout the region of Kazan. The newspaper is filled with information about how to obtain better health, and it offers spiritual insights. It is one of the most popular newspapers in Russia. The two former mafia men also work together finding sponsors so that thousands of Seventh-day Adventist books can be ordered and distributed around Kazan. “Our stories seem to be terrible,”Vasily said. “But actually it is our world. Igor and I just want to help people find a better way.”

The two former mafia men are delighted to have a new church and center of influence in the center of Kazan, made possible in part through your generous Thirteenth Sabbath Offering in 2014. Thank you for supporting this important offering.
