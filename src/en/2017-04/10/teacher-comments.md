### The Lesson in Brief

**Key Text**: Romans 9

**The Student Will**:

- **Know**: Grasp the reality that God has not forsaken Israel and that He wants to save all—both Jews and Gentiles.
- **Feel**: Develop a convincing sense that while God desires to save all, He alone chooses who carries out particular missions in His kingdom.
- **Do**: Seek to clarify the difference between whom God saves and whom He appoints as His saving agents.

### Learning Outline:

1. Know: How God Redeems the Lost
+ Why was it that Israel so obviously had misunderstood its divine destiny?
+ Why has God never made an unconditional covenant to save any people or religious group?

2. Feel: Sense God’s Patience With the Failures of Israel.
+ The Jewish rejection and crucifixion of Christ could have brought rejection by God, so why has God not fully rejected Israel?
+ Have you ever really blown an important job opportunity yet gotten a second chance? Please share your reaction to this special blessing.

3. Do: Yield to God’s Will.
+ Why might someone be jealous of another’s ministry?
+ How does the fact that God determines who receives what when it comes to “spiritual gifts” speak to God’s service appointments?

**Summary**: It is important to seek to understand God’s will to save both Jew and Gentile and to clarify how He chooses whomever He will to reach the lost.

#### Learning Cycle

##### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Romans 9

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: It is critically important to understand that God does not predetermine anyone’s eternal salvation. But He does determine who will do His bidding when it comes to mission assignments and spiritual gifting. In such a life of Christian witness and service, there is a great blessing in being a part of God’s redemptive purposes.

**Just for Teachers**: God does not predetermine anyone’s personal salvation. But He has been quite sovereign when it comes to Israel’s destiny as God’s chosen mission witnesses to the lost human race. So, this week’s key question is: How does God relate to the failures of His Old Testament people in the context of His desire for the salvation of both Jews and Gentiles?

**Opening Discussion**: Recall the first time that you ever read Romans 9. What questions immediately came to your mind regarding God’s seemingly irresistible predestination, especially as it related to questions addressing personal salvation from sin and eternal death?

**Questions for Discussion**:

1. What is it in God’s nature that assures us that He is not a Being who irresistibly predetermines everyone’s eternal destiny?
2. Why does Paul seem so burdened regarding the salvation of the Jews?
3. Consider Paul’s obvious preoccupation with what has been called “the Jewish question” in Romans 9. What contributed to Paul’s anxious puzzlement over the fact that the Jews were resisting the gospel, while a great number of Gentiles gladly flocked into the churches and freely embraced it?

##### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: While we seek to justify God’s desire to save all sinful humans, the key question that Romans 9 addresses is: How does God intend ultimately to redeem the Israelite (Jewish) people, in spite of their past failures? In other words, as part of our search, we need to follow carefully Paul’s argument that seeks to justify God’s redemptive providences in saving all, both Jew and Gentile.

**Bible Commentary**

**I. Paul’s Burden and Purpose for Both Jews and Gentiles** (Review Romans 9:1–13 with your class.)

In these verses, Paul seeks to demonstrate that God’s plan to use Israel has not totally failed, as it is still producing a “remnant” of the seed of Abraham. So, while God has been selective, His will to save the lost is slowly but surely being effected. For instance, Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, was chosen, and he (by faith in God’s promises and power) begot a son named Isaac; then Isaac by faith begot Jacob, the direct progenitor of the tribes of Israel. Therefore, though God has been suffering setbacks, He is steadily, persistently, and providentially raising up a faithful “seed,” or redeemed children. And these miracle children are becoming His progenitors of Israel and agents of salvation in a world racked by sin and hopelessness.

**Consider This**: Even though God has been selective in choosing His special servants, what evidence do we have that God has, or has not, been arbitrary in whom He saves?

**II. God’s Elected Messengers to the World** (Review Romans 9:14–24 with your class.)

Paul now continues his argument by citing Exodus 33:19 and 9:16 in order to make the point that God will have “mercy on whomever” He chooses. And He will show His “compassion” and His “power . . . in all the earth” (Rom. 9:15, 17, NKJV). Paul also sets forth God’s sovereign “power” in the illustration of the divine Potter, whose prerogative it is to shape the clay as He chooses (Rom. 9:19–24). So, clearly God is the One who is in charge when it comes to deciding who will do His missionary will on the earth.

**Discussion Question**: God is in charge of choosing His missionary agencies. Does this fact negate His ability to impart to humans the right to choose to accept or reject their eternal salvation? Why, or why not?

**III. God Is in Charge of His Mission to Save the World.** (Review Romans 9:25–33 with your class.)

Spend a few moments going over the Old Testament passages cited by Paul that prophesy about God’s mission to the Gentiles (such as Hos. 2:23; 1:10; Isa. 10:22, 23; 1:9, and 13:19).

**Consider This**: What evidence is given in these verses that points to God’s passion to save both Jews and Gentiles?

**IV. A Universal Offer of Salvation** (Review 1 Timothy 2:3, 4; 4:10; John 3:16; Titus 2:11; and 2 Peter 3:9 with your class.)

The texts for review clearly witness to a universal offer of salvation. But how do they, in turn, relate to Paul’s thesis of God’s sovereign choice of Israel to do His missionary bidding?

In answer to this question, let’s ponder these five texts, which seem to clearly speak of a free-grace, freewill version of salvation:

1. “God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved” (1 Tim. 2:3, 4, NKJV); compared with
2. “God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe” (1 Tim. 4:10, NKJV);
3. “ ‘For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life’ ” (John 3:16, NKJV);
4. “For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men” (Titus 2:11, NKJV); and
5. “The Lord . . . is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance” (2 Pet. 3:9, NKJV).

**Consider This**: Recall the question that commenced this section: What are we to make of these verses? By way of answering, ponder the following rationale: If Paul means in Romans 9 that God has irresistibly predetermined the salvation of all men, regardless of their freely given, grace-and faith-based response to the gospel, then we have caught the Scriptures in a gross contradiction. What is to be made of this supposed conundrum? It then would seem “logical” to conclude that the great controversy theme is effectually shorn of its interpretive power to explain the origin of sin and suffering. The terrible result of this conclusion would be that God is left as the sole cause of evil and the Bestower of an arbitrary salvation from the wages of sin. How does a correct understanding of Bible truth in Romans 9 overturn this false assumption?

##### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Invite your class to ponder the last question posed regarding the dynamics of the great controversy theme in the previous step, and then tackle the following questions:

**Application Questions**:

1. There is a theme that is often referred to in philosophy and theology as “theodicy.” Namely, it is the question of how we can go about vindicating or properly “judging” God in the face of the problem of seemingly unmitigated human suffering and sorrow. How have you struggled to make sense of the problem of evil?
2. How does our explanation of Romans 9 make contextual sense in the unfolding argument of Paul in Romans? Or have we improperly imported a “freewill, free-grace” theme that is alien to Paul’s overall thought? Discuss.
3. Is it fair to Paul to place him in the larger narrative of the biblical canon when it comes to the numerous freewill, free-grace passages cited above?
4. How does the great controversy provide a satisfactory explanation of the problem of evil and the inconceivable amount of human suffering and loss manifested in the history of this world?

##### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: As your class wrestles with Romans 9 and Paul’s struggle with the Judaizers, seek to lead them into a sympathetic identity with Paul and his missionary burdens for both Jews and Gentiles.

**Activities**:

1. Ask the class to reread reflectively Paul’s anguished, even “hand-wringing,” confession of concern for the salvation of the Jews in Romans 9:1–4. Then ponder the second activity listed.
2. After reflecting on your experience of Christian witness and service, ask yourselves (first individually, then as a class) if you have ever reached the point where you were willing to die either “with” (as Moses) or “for” (as Paul) the Christians and the non-Christians in your life.
3. As Paul ponders the differing ways that “Israel” (particularly first-century “Jews”) and the “Gentiles” have related to the gospel in Romans 9:30–33, he then compares the two contrasting experiences of those who pursue “the law of righteousness” (Rom. 9:31). He identifies these two experiences as (a) “the righteousness of faith” (Rom. 9:30, NKJV) and (b) “works of the law” (Rom. 9:32). What would be some key characteristics that could help the followers of Christ to discern the distinctions between experiences that have been based on “faith” as opposed to those based on “works of the law”?
