#### From Cigarettes to Castles: Part 2

One day at church an invitation for baptism was given. Whoever wished to be baptized was given materials, including a review of the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s fundamental beliefs.

This whole spiritual experience happened very rapidly for me—in less than two months. With cigarette in hand, I began filling out the baptismal request form. As I continued reading, I read about abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. I didn’t know how I was going to quit.

In February 1997, I was baptized. While I stopped drinking right away, I still struggled with tobacco. I tried everything to quit smoking, but nothing worked. Finally, I prayed, “Lord, please take it away from me.”And He did.

My aunt, who lives in another village, invited me to help her around the house for a week. There was only one store that sold cigarettes, and it wasn’t close. When I arrived, I told my aunt that I was now a Christian and was no longer the person I was used to be. But she didn’t know I still struggled with smoking. Every day she gave me work to do. Four days passed without cigarettes. The fifth day, I came back home and still hadn’t smoked a cigarette. Now I see that being at my aunt’s was like a rehab center for me. I’m amazed at God’s wisdom and how He found a way for me to quit smoking.

When I was planning to be baptized, my sisters told me that I should ask my parents for forgiveness. Both of my parents were crying with happiness. That’s when I realized that you can have all sorts of victories with God.

One thing that amazed me was that as we started to build a church, people brought offerings to the church such as gold and jewelry, and, knowing my past, they commissioned me to sell it. I was amazed and touched with that kind of trust.

Later I became a literature evangelist (LE) and youth leader. It was during a gathering of LEs that I met my future wife, Bogdona!

We now have three lovely daughters, and I’m an elder in our church. I’m just amazed at how God was able to turn me around and give me this life that I never even had dreamed of. In a way, my dad was right—the end did come in 1999; the end of my former life.

There is one thing I regret—the years of my youth that were spent in vain. They were completely empty years—no purpose, no meaning, no satisfaction, and no direction. I understand now that it’s better to live with God.You can have all kinds of victories in your life when you’re with God, when you pray sincerely to Him.
