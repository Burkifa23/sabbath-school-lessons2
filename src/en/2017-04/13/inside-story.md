#### Saved in the Sky: Part 2

I opened my heavy coat and tried using it to break my free fall. Then I began praying the most earnest prayer I have ever prayed, believing it was probably going to be my last:

“God, there’s nothing I can do to save myself, but I really want to see Your hand at this moment.”

I realized that the worst thing I had ever done was deciding to leave God. What would happen to me now? An apartment in Leningrad and all the military honors in the world didn’t matter anymore.

Looking below, I could see the open parachute of my commander. All of a sudden, some wind came and pushed me right into his parachute!

But you can’t stay on top of a parachute for long. As I slid off, my commander grabbed me with his strong hands and held on with an iron grip! We were falling fast, and he told me how to hold my feet so we could land as safely as possible. After landing, we were taken to the hospital with only minor injuries.

The next day, a story appeared in the newspaper about this extraordinary experience. Everyone recognized that things such as this don’t just happen. It was a miracle.

From then on, my prayers were different from what they had been before. Two weeks later, when I had my appointment with the general, my answer was ready.

As I walked into his office, he looked at me and smiled. He was quite sure that I would agree right away to his proposal.

“Sir,” I told him, “I have thought about your generous offer, and I have decided not to stay in the army.”

Shocked, he asked, “What will you do?”

“Well, sir, I will follow the call of the party. I’m going to go to new places and cultivate new territory.”At that time, the Communists wanted to develop land in Siberia and were encouraging people to settle there.

The general stared at me. “Well, soldier, I’ve seen many crazy people, but you are the craziest of them all!”

After his time in the military, Pastor Zhukaljuk secretly worked as a pastor and organized the underground work of publishing religious books and materials for the Seventh-day Adventist believers in the Soviet Union. He and his wife, Yevgenia, were imprisoned for this work and later released. They have been married for 63 years.
