#### Saved in the Sky: Part 1

**Editor’s Note**: _Pastor Nikolai Zhukaljuk has served the Seventh-day Adventist Church for more than 40 years as a pastor, writer, publisher, and former president of the Ukrainian Union Conference. In the story below, he shares a pivotal moment from his time in the Soviet military._

My time for mandatory service in the Soviet army was nearly finished. One of my responsibilities was to serve as a journalist for the military newspaper. My superiors were pleased with my work and wanted me to continue as senior editor. They offered me an apartment in Leningrad, which was very difficult to obtain during that time. There was just one condition—I would have to become a Communist. During Soviet times, a person couldn’t work in such positions without being a Communist.

In a few days, I was invited to meet with the general. He told me, “You can continue with military service. We’ll give you officer rank, and you can stay with us. You will have business trips, travel to different places, and work with the military district. You can stay in the army and work here.”

So now I had two proposals—to become a chief editor or a military officer. This was a great temptation—I was thinking of what it would mean to become an officer and of all the things I would get. On the other hand, to have an apartment in Leningrad was a dream for me! I seriously considered accepting one of these offers, even though it would mean renouncing my faith in God and becoming a Communist.

At that time, I also served as a military skydiver and had participated in about 80 jumps. One day, as we prepared for another jump, the chief commander told me, “I’ll go first, and you will be the last one to jump. We will have 15 soldiers in between.” The parachutes of all the soldiers ahead of me would open automatically, but I would need to open mine manually. I thought this would be fine; I’m brave, I’m very experienced, I’ve done this many times before.

I jumped last. After a brief free fall, I pulled the rip cord. Nothing happened. Trying not to panic, I reached for the emergency cord and pulled. Again, no parachute appeared. There was nothing but blue sky above and the ground coming up fast below. I understood that this was the end. The feeling that overwhelmed me at that point is something only someone who has been in the sky can fully understand.
