#### “Find the Book”

Gahida* was born into a Muslim family, in a country of the former USSR. For decades, she followed the religion of her family. One day as she was praying, Gahida saw an angel who told her to “Find the Book . . . Find the Book.” Gahida wondered what “the Book” was.

Five years later, she received the answer. A Seventh-day Adventist evangelist came to her city, and Gahida decided to attend the meetings. There she saw a Bible for the first time and was able to buy one.

“When I began reading the Bible, I realized that this was ‘the Book’that the angel told me to find,”recalls Gahida. She soon found many parallels between her Bible and the Quran.

Although she enjoyed the meetings, Gahida didn’t immediately become an Adventist. She was afraid that God would punish her.The evangelist, however, was praying for her, and Gahida decided to visit the church “just once.”

“The sermon was about the Samaritan woman in John 4. I knew it was me,” recalls Gahida. “I was like that Samaritan woman, searching for something better. When I fell in love with Jesus, I understood that He is the best—I don’t need anything but Christ!”

Gahida was baptized and, after a while, wanted to find a way to share her new faith with those who were still in her former religious community. She decided to write a book about her own spiritual journey and compare some elements of her previous faith with Bible teachings. She prayed much about publishing the book and received enough donations to print 1,500 copies.

Unafraid, she hand delivered her book to hundreds of religious leaders of her previous faith. “You need to think about what you believe in, and I think you’ll find this book helpful,” she said.

Gahida also has translated several books by Ellen G. White into her native language, but one book, Patriarchs and Prophets, almost wasn’t published.

“When the central press received my translation files, it was a time of great political unrest. Someone tried to kill the country’s president, and immediately all publishing houses were closed. Government agents checked every publishing house, looking for controversial material. When the agents came to the central press, the chief editor wasn’t able to switch on one of the computers. It was the only computer that had the translated files for Patriarchs and Prophets. After the government agents left, the computer easily turned on and they were able to print the book.

“It would have been very expensive to publish,” Gahida recalled, “but we didn’t have to pay anything. The chief editor told us, ‘This is a great work that you’re doing—we can’t take any money from you.’ ”

Gahida is thankful for the special ministry that God has given her. “Many are very grateful to receive these materials,” she said, “and through her writings, Ellen White has become my best friend.”
