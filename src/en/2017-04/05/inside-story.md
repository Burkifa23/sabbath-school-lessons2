#### From Mafia Men to God’s Messengers: Part 1

Although his grandfather was an Imam, and many relatives were Muslims, Igor had a secular upbringing. Excelling in sports, he soon became a leader,respected—and feared—by the other boys on the street.

That leadership, respect, and fear followed Igor into adulthood, where he became highly involved in the mafia. Big guns, big money, and big deals became integral parts of his life. But in spite of the thrills and excitement his fast life was delivering, Igor felt that something was missing. There was a hole that he just couldn’t seem to fill, so he went searching.

First, out of curiosity, he visited the Hare Krishna people. Then he went to the Russian Orthodox Church and then to the mosque, but still Igor didn’t find the elusive “something.”

One day, a friend told Igor that he knew a man who owned a Bible. Intrigued, Igor wanted to know more, so the friend put the two in touch. “Do you know,” the Bible owner asked Igor, “that in the Bible you can read about unclean foods—and how you aren’t allowed to eat pork?” This was new to Igor; he thought only the Quran taught such things.

Over the next few months, Igor called this believer, who always patiently explained things from the Bible, numerous times. Finally, the believer invited Igor to attend church with him.

“I’ll never visit your church,” Igor rudely responded. But the Bible believer didn’t lose heart and continued keeping in contact with this tough mafia man. Six months later, he again invited Igor to visit his church, and this time Igor accepted.

On Sabbath, Igor got into his car (after following his usual routine of checking for any hidden explosive devices) and drove to the church.

The church group met in a small, rented facility that didn’t look like much; nevertheless, Igor felt drawn to the place. Some church members eyed the mafia man with suspicion, but Igor continued attending. As he learned more from the Bible, Igor compared it with the Quran.

“I was fairly well acquainted with history,” Igor recalled, “and I could compare the teachings of the two books. Eventually, it was the truth of the Bible that won me over.”

Before his baptism, Igor studied the Bible with the Seventh-day Adventist pastor, peppering him with questions during each meeting. Then a prominent evangelist came to Kazan, and at the end of those meetings, Igor was baptized—at the age of 35.

“When I was baptized, I understood that I could no longer take part in things that happened on the streets. But even though I didn’t do those bad things anymore, I was still a hooligan,” Igor admits.
