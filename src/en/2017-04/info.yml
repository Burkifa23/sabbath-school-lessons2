  title: "Salvation by Faith Alone. Book of Romans"
  description: "Five hundred years ago this month, Martin Luther, a 33-year-old theology professor, posted his Ninety-Five Theses. And although he was seeking, at first, merely to refute a papal charlatan who was milking his flock by selling indulgences, Luther’s act of defiance became the spark that ignited the Protestant Reformation—and the world has never been the same since."
