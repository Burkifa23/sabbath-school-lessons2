### Part I: Overview 

**Key Text**: Revelation 6:17 

**Study Focus**: Revelation 7 answers the question of Revelation 6:17: Who will be able to stand at the second coming of Jesus? 

**Introduction**: Revelation 7 reveals the importance of being sealed in order to survive the calamities that accompany the Second Coming. 

**Lesson Themes**: The lesson and the focus passage introduce the following themes: 

**I. The Meaning of Seals and Sealing** 

Documents are sealed to conceal or validate their contents. People are sealed as a sign of ownership or for protection. 

**II. Ephesians 4:30 and the Cosmic Conflict** 

In context, the grieving of the Spirit is a localized version of the cosmic conflict. 

**III. Is the Number 144,000 Literal or Symbolic?** 

The lesson interprets the number symbolically, which is supported in theme III in Part II. 

**IV. Are the 144,000 and the Great Multitude Two Different Groups or Two Ways of Describing the Same End-Time People of God?** 

The lesson is ambiguous regarding the answer to this question. See further discussion of this issue in the “Commentary” section in part II. 

**V. Romans 3:19–24 and the Meaning of “Without Fault” (Rev. 14:5)** 

The lesson references Romans 3 to argue against a perfectionistic interpretation of “without fault.” This argument is further elaborated in part II. 

**Life Application**: Class members are invited to reflect on God’s restraining of evil in today’s world, and the meanings of both the military imagery in Revelation 7:1–8 and the new song that only the 144,000 can sing (Rev. 14:3). 

### Part II: Commentary 

Chapter 7 is inserted parenthetically between the sixth (Rev. 6:12–17) and seventh (Rev. 8:1) seals. Chapter 6 closes with the opponents of God calling on the rocks and mountains to hide them from the face of God and the wrath of the Lamb (Rev. 6:15, 16). They then close with the poignant statement, “For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?” (Rev. 6:17, NKJV). That question is answered in chapter 7 with the appearance of two groups: the 144,000 (Rev. 7:4–8) and the great multitude (Rev. 7:9–14). In order to survive the calamities that accompany the Second Coming, it is necessary to be sealed (Rev. 7:1–3). The end result is a people who stand blameless before the throne of God (Rev. 14:5) and serve Him in His temple (Rev. 7:15). The purpose of Revelation 7 and 14, within their larger context, is to identify what God’s people will be like just before the Second Coming. 

**Main Themes of Lesson 6 Elaborated**: 

**I. The Meaning of Seals and Sealing** 

In the ancient world, sealing a book had two main purposes. One sealed a book to conceal its contents from view (Isa. 29:11, Rev. 10:4) or to validate the contents as being authentic or official (1 Kings 21:8, Esther 8:8, Jer. 32:44). Concealment seems to be the basic purpose of sealing the book in Revelation 5. The book was already validated by being in God’s possession. Breaking the seals and opening the book would bring its contents into view. 

A more symbolic use of the word sealing had to do with people. Sealing a person could be a sign of ownership (Eph. 1:13, Eph. 4:30, 2 Tim. 2:19, Rev. 14:1) or a sign of protection (Ezek. 9:4–6). In early Judaism sealing was associated with circumcision. In second-century Christianity, sealing was associated with baptism. So the sealing of the people by God would be a sign that they belong to God (2 Tim. 2:19, Rev. 9:4) and that God knows the ones who belong to Him. In a spiritual sense, sealing validates where a person stands with God. 

But the sealing of Revelation 7 is different. Here the “servants of God” (Rev. 7:3 [already sealed in the first sense]) are sealed as a protection against the calamities that accompany the end time (Rev. 6:15– 7:3). See the first point under the “Life Application” section below. 

**II. Ephesians 4:30 and the Cosmic Conflict** 

In light of the discussion above, it may surprise some that the lesson refers to Ephesians 4:30 in the context of this end-time sealing for protection. 

The context of Ephesians 4:30 is a list of moral behaviors that grieve the Spirit (Eph. 4:25–5:2). But there is an apocalyptic element to this list of behaviors. Believers are to give “no opportunity to the devil” (Eph. 4:27, RSV, ESV). Instead, they are to be imitators of God (Eph. 5:1). So grieving the Spirit is in the context of the cosmic conflict between God and Satan. The believer is to imitate the character of God (truth, honesty, graceful and encouraging speech, kindness, tenderheartedness, forgiveness, love, self-sacrifice), rather than the character of Satan (lying, anger, stealing, abusive speech, bitterness, hardheartedness, slander, hatred). As is the case in the book of Revelation, the little battles of daily character work are tied to the much bigger conflict in the universe. 

**III. Is the Number 144,000 Literal or Symbolic?** 

A symbolic reading of the number is to be preferred. 

1. The list of 12 tribes is not found in this form anywhere else; it is not a literal list. In proof of point, Judah is listed first, instead of Reuben. Joseph (father of Ephraim and Manasseh) replaces Ephraim. The tribe of Dan is missing from the list, and Levi is included (compare Num. 1:5–15, Num. 13:4–15). They also are not listed in birth order (Gen. 49:3–28). 
2. Revelation 1:1 tells us the whole book of Revelation was “signified” (KJV [Greek: esêmanen, often translated “made known”]) in symbolic language referring to the future. So in Revelation the best way to approach the text is to treat everything as a symbol, unless it is obvious that a literal meaning is intended. 
3. Interpreting the tribes as literal descendants of Jacob flies in the face of the fact that at least 10 of those tribes are essentially lost to history. Some Jews can still trace their lineage back to Judah, Benjamin, or Levi—but not the rest. 

**IV. Are the 144,000 and the Great Multitude Two Different Groups or Two Ways of Describing the Same End-Time People of God?** 

Some believe that the two groups are different; some believe that they are the same. In this lesson, we will first look at an argument for the groups being the same. 

The terms used for God’s end-time people are often interchangeable in Revelation. John never sees the 144,000 in chapter seven. He hears the number (Rev. 7:4), but “after these things” when he looks, he sees a group that no one can number, a great multitude (Rev. 7:9). This is said to be a literary pattern in Revelation. John hears one thing (Lion) then sees its opposite (Lamb); but the two are different ways of describing one reality (Rev. 5:5, 6; see also Rev. 1:10–12; Rev. 17:1, 3). 

On the other hand, there are many who believe that the 144,000 and the great multitude are two different groups—the former representing God’s end-time people and the latter representing God’s people throughout all the ages. Those supporting this view usually point out the differences between the groups. The 144,000 are a number from the 12 tribes of Israel who are seen on the earth and appear before the four winds are released. In contrast, the great multitude cannot be numbered, are from every nation, are seen before the throne, and appear after the great tribulation. Also, Revelation 14:1–5 further distinguishes the 144,000 from that group. 

**V. Romans 3:19–24 and the Meaning of “Without Fault” (Rev. 14:5)** 

Romans 3 makes clear that nothing a human being can do earns justification before God (Rom. 3:20). All have sinned and therefore fall short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). The present tense of “fall short” (NKJV [Greek: husterountai]) means that we will always need a Savior and the forgiveness that His sacrifice has provided for us. Not until the sins are blotted out and we are given the finishing touch of immortality will that change. So “without fault” does not mean without the need of forgiveness. It means the kind of loyalty in which one would rather die than sin. The 144,000 trust Jesus to keep their robes clean (Rev. 7:14) and are uncompromising in their obedience to the One who redeemed them (Rev. 14:4, 5). It is His righteousness after all. 

### Part III: Life Application 

1. Reflecting on Revelation 7:1–3, do you think we are living in a time when God is restraining evil forces or a time when they are being let loose? If God is the One restraining, who is the one doing all the damage? When God does act in judgment, why does He do so? Some possible answers include the following: In many ways today’s turbulent times seem as if everything is falling apart. On the other hand, compared to the horrors of the Holocaust and World War II, the casualties of terrorism are fairly minor in scope, and most neighborhoods seem reasonably safe. So one could argue we still live in a time of restraint. The finger of blame for the evils in the world falls clearly on Satan in the book of Revelation (Rev. 9:11, Rev. 12:12). He, not God, is the destroyer. When God acts in judgment, the purpose is not usually to destroy but to discipline His people (as in Rev. 3:19, Heb. 12:5–7) or to deliver them from harm by evil forces (Rev. 20:7–10). Satan is relentless in his pursuit of destruction. If it were not for the restraining influence of God’s Spirit, things would be far worse than they are now. When God does execute His final judgment to destroy sin and sinners, it is called His “strange act” (Isa. 28:21). 
2. Why is there so much military imagery in the Bible? Military imagery is familiar to people today, as well, given that the news, action movies, and spy thrillers keep war activity at the center of people’s consciousness. God meets people where they are, using familiar language to illustrate spiritual truths. In Revelation, careful observation tells us that the most important battles are often a war of words and ideas. The war in heaven is between Christ and the “accuser of our brethren” (Rev. 12:10, 11). Those who survive the battle of Armageddon are those practicing spiritual watchfulness (Rev. 16:14–16). 
3. What is the meaning of the “new song” in Revelation 14:3? Why can no one sing that song except the 144,000? The 144,000 have a unique experience, passing through the character-shaping events of the end time (Rev. 7:1–3, Rev. 14:1–5). The tribulations of the end time will develop in them a unique appreciation for Christ that would not have happened otherwise. God does not will the troubles of the end time, but He uses them to enhance the Christlikeness of His followers. The end-time believers will then be able to play a unique role in eternity (Rev. 7:14, 15 [see theme IV in the “Commentary” section in Part II]).
