### Part I: Overview 

**Key Text**: Revelation 10:7 

**Study Focus**: The seven trumpets (Rev. 8:2–11:18) build on a vision of the heavenly ministry and the incense altar (Rev. 8:3, 4) and contain an “interlude” (Rev. 10:1–11:14) that offers a view of God’s people in the midst of the horrific sixth trumpet (Rev. 9:13–21). 

**Introduction**: The purpose of the trumpets is clarified in connection with the fifth seal (Rev. 6:9–11). Reference to both the golden altar of incense and the altar of burnt offering, as well as to the prayers of the saints in Revelation 8:3, 4, connects the trumpets with the scene in Revelation 6:9, 10. The seven trumpets answer the prayers of the saints for judgment on those who have persecuted them. Therefore, the events portrayed in the trumpets likely fall on the opponents of God’s people throughout Christian history. 

**Lesson Themes**: The lesson and the focus passage introduce the following themes: 

I. The Meaning of Trumpets in the Bible 

II. The Time When the Trumpets Begin 

III. The Meaning of the Imagery in the First Six Trumpets 

IV. The Relation of the “Interlude” to the Seven Trumpets 

V. The Allusion to Daniel 12 in Revelation 10 

**Life Application**: After reading about the trumpets, consider how the trumpets and the fifth seal offer encouragement to those who suffer for the sake of the gospel and reveal the fate of those who oppose the gospel. 

### Part II: Commentary 

The seven trumpets of Revelation (particularly Rev. 8:2–9:21) is one of the most difficult passages in the Bible to interpret. Adventist students of the Bible have not come to agreement on its meaning through the years. But there are aspects of the passage that are reasonably clear, and some of these are elaborated below. 

**Main Themes of Lesson 7 Elaborated**: 

**I. The Meaning of Trumpets in the Bible** 

The Greek words for trumpets and trumpeting occur 144 times in the Greek translation of the Old Testament. The vast majority of those references (105 out of 144) concern either signaling in warfare, worship, and prayer—or a combination thereof. The clearest single passage on the meaning of trumpets is Numbers 10:8–10. In ancient Israel the trumpets were always to be handled by the priests (Num. 10:8), even in warfare. So there is a spiritual meaning that Israel was to discern in the blowing of trumpets. Signaling trumpets represented a prayer to God for intervention in battle (Num. 10:9). Likewise, in the temple and on the feast days, the blowing of trumpets invited God’s spiritual intervention in the lives of His people (Num. 10:10). So the essential meaning of trumpets in the Old Testament is covenant-based prayer, calling on God to remember His people. 

Most of the occurrences of trumpets and trumpeting in the New Testament are in Revelation 8 and 9. At first glance, it might seem that signaling in warfare is the primary meaning in the seven trumpets of Revelation. But the connection between the trumpets and the fifth seal (see “Introduction”) underlines the prayer theme as the primary one here, too. The trumpets are a response to the prayers of the suffering saints of God (Rev. 6:9, 10; Rev. 8:2–6). It assures them that God has noticed their suffering, and, even though He may seem silent in their experience, He is already acting in history against those who have persecuted them (compare Rev. 6:10 and Rev. 8:13 [see “Life Application” number 1]). 

**II. The Time When the Trumpets Begin** 

The throwing down of the censer (or fire) in Revelation 8:5 suggests to some Adventist interpreters a glimpse of the close of probation. The seven trumpets seem to forecast events in the course of Christian history leading up to that event. A number of indications in the text substantiate this interpretation. 

First, the pattern in the first half of the book is that the visions begin with the New Testament era and cover events throughout Christian history. Second, whatever the casting down of the censer (fire) in Revelation 8:5 means, probation is clearly not yet closed at the time of the sixth trumpet. The intercession at the altar is still taking place (Rev. 9:13). The gospel is still going forth (Rev. 10:11; 11:3–6). That the “interlude” of Revelation 10:1–11:13 should be included in our understanding of the sixth trumpet is shown in theme IV on page 96. Finally, the proclamation of the gospel ends and probation fully closes only at the sounding of the seventh trumpet (Rev. 10:7). So the seven trumpets of Revelation seem to cover the whole course of history from John’s day to the close of probation and final events. 

**III. The Meaning of the Imagery in the First Six Trumpets** 

1. The first trumpet uses the Old Testament language of God’s judgments (hail, fire, and blood [Exod. 9:23–26, Isa. 10:16–20, Ezek. 38:22]) directed against symbols of God’s Old Testament people (vegetation and trees [Ps. 1:1–3; Isa. 61:3; Jer. 11:16, 17]). Hence comes the lesson’s suggestion that the first trumpet represents God’s judgment on the Jerusalem that had rejected Christ (Matt. 23:37, 38; Luke 23:28–31). 
2. The second trumpet recalls, in general, God’s judgments on those who opposed Him (Exod. 7:19–21), and in particular the fall of ancient Babylon (Jer. 51:24, 25, 41, 42). The lesson, therefore, associates this trumpet with the fall of the Roman Empire (compare Peter’s apparent designation of Rome as “Babylon” in 1 Pet. 5:13). 
3. The symbolism of the third trumpet parallels biblical imagery for the work of Satan (Isa. 14:12–19, Luke 10:18, Rev. 12:9). But the symbolism of lamp, springs, rivers, and water suggests spiritual life and growth (Ps. 1:3; Ps. 84:6, 7; Ps. 119:105; Jer. 2:13). The falling of the stars and the embittering of the waters connect the two ideas, suggesting a perversion of truth and a rise of apostasy. The lesson, therefore, associates this trumpet with the condition of the church in the Middle Ages. 
4. In the fourth trumpet, the sources of light (sun, moon, and stars) are darkened, the symbols of truth are partially eclipsed. This darkening could represent the deepening of apostasy in the church (Exod. 10:21–23, Job 38:2, Isa. 8:22, John 1:4–11, John 3:18–21). 
5. With the fifth trumpet, the partial darkness of the fourth becomes total and worldwide (Rev. 9:1, 2). This represents the triumph of religious apostasy and secularism in the modern age. With God and truth totally eclipsed, sinful humankind is left to the demonic torment of destructive desires (Rev. 9:3–11, Luke 10:17–20). The only safety is in a genuine relationship with God (Rev. 9:4; Eph. 1:13, 14). 
6. While the first five trumpets have many allusions to ancient Egypt, the sixth trumpet particularly echoes biblical accounts regarding ancient Babylon. There are references to the river of Babylon (Rev. 9:14), the idolatry of Babylon (Rev. 9:20; Dan. 5:4, 23), and the fall of Babylon (Rev. 9:21, Isa. 47:9–12). There also are many parallels with the sixth bowl (Euphrates, battle language, demonic imagery [Rev. 16:12–16]). So the sixth trumpet describes an opposition to God similar to that of end-time Babylon (Rev. 17:4, 5). 

**IV. The Relation of the “Interlude” to the Seven Trumpets** 

The trumpets focus on the wicked (Rev. 9:4, 20, 21), but the “interlude” (Rev. 10:1–11:13) focuses on God’s people. The “interlude,” however, is not separate from the trumpets; it is part of the sixth trumpet. Revelation 8:13 describes three woes coming upon those who live on the earth. The first is the fifth trumpet (Rev. 9:12). The second woe is the sixth trumpet, but it does not end until Revelation 11:14. So the bulk of chapters 10 and 11 are part of the sixth trumpet. While the forces of evil are gathering for the final crisis during the sixth trumpet (Rev. 9:16), the forces of the righteous are gathering to counter them (Rev. 7:4, Rev. 10:1–11:13). 

**V. The Allusion to Daniel 12 in Revelation 10** 

One of the clearest allusions to the Old Testament in all of Revelation is found in Revelation 10:5, 6. Revelation 10:5, 6 and Daniel 12:7 have eight major words in common. Both passages have heavenly figures standing on or above bodies of water. In both cases, the heavenly figure raises his hand to heaven and swears by the One who lives forever and ever. The connection between the “time, times, and half a time” of Daniel 12:7 (NKJV) with the “time no longer” of Revelation 10:6 indicates that the angel of Revelation 10 is announcing the close of Daniel’s time prophecies in the context of the sixth trumpet (preparation for the final events, see theme IV above). 

### Part III: Life Application 

The material in the seven trumpets does not lend itself to a great deal of life application. But the teacher could ask the following questions, with possible answers suggested: 

1. How does the connection between the introduction to the trumpets (Rev. 8:3–5) and the fifth seal (Rev. 6:9–11) offer encouragement to those suffering for the sake of the gospel today? The martyrs’ cry for judgment in the fifth seal is answered by the seven trumpets. The message of the trumpets is that God sees the suffering of His people and responds to the injustice, not only at the end of time— but throughout the course of history. Like Job, we may not always understand what God is doing, but we have reason to trust Him even in the darkest times. 
2. The judgments of the first two trumpets fall on those powers that combined to crucify Jesus (the religious authorities of Jerusalem under Caiaphas and Roman civil authority under Pilate). What does this fact tell us about opposition to the gospel? Opposition to the gospel tends to come in two distinct forms—opposition from inside the church and from outside the church. Jesus was crucified when the leaders of Israel (inside) combined forces with outside powers (Rome).The greatest opposition often comes from those who profess the same faith but are really wolves in sheep’s clothing. 

A similar dynamic is seen in the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11–32). The father is ultimately rejected by the son who stayed. While appearing to be loyal, in the end he is motivated by selfish gain.
