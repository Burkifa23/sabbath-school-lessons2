**Introduction**: Rom. 11:28–36

**The Road to Reconciliation**

Welcome to Sinners Anonymous (SA). We are an international organization of individuals who have struggled with sin at some point or another. There is a multistep process each member must participate in to be a part of God’s family.

The twelve-step process that alcoholics go through as members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the same with our Christian walk. The Jews’ rejection of Christ as the Messiah and their pride caused others to have the opportunity to fully accept Jesus’ sacrifice—His paying the price for sin on the cross as a gift. The steps in AA are the same for us as Christians:

1. Admit we are powerless over sin.
2. Believe in a Power greater than us to restore us to sanity.
3. Decide to turn our wills and lives over to God as we understand Him.
4. Allow the Spirit of God to search us.
5. Admit to God, ourselves, and other human beings the exact nature of our wrongs.
6. Have God remove all defects of character.
7. Humbly ask Him to remove our shortcomings.
8. Make a list of all persons we have harmed and become willing to make amends with them all.
9. Make direct amends with such people wherever possible, except when doing so would injure them or others.
10. Continue to take personal inventory, and when wrong, promptly admit it.
11. Through prayer and meditation, improve our conscious contact with God, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, carry this message to sinners and practice these principles in all our affairs.<sup>1</sup>

This week we will see that even though we might not understand why God does what He does, through His infinite wisdom we are able to have a relationship with Him and share in His promises for His people. In Romans 11:36 (BLB) “from Him” means that God is the all-sufficient Cause and Source of everything. “Through Him” means that God is the mighty Sustainer and Worker. “Unto Him” means that God must call every creature to give account to Him. All glory is indeed due Him.
