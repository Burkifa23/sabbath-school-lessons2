**Opinion**: Rom. 10:17

In a world that is becoming increasingly modern, many people who claim to follow Christ live lives that are merely a formality or a set of empty customs. Sometimes it takes experiencing a devastating life event, and maybe a miracle, to have one’s faith reinvigorated. A question we should ask ourselves is, “Should our faith depend on circumstances or on God, no matter the circumstance?’

A plane crash occurred, and rescue teams came to help the passengers who were still floating in the ocean. The pilot of the emergency helicopter lowered a rope and some life vests to the passengers. In this case, at first glance, it might seem that the rope and life vests saved them; actually it was the pilot who saved them.

However, the rope is needed to connect passengers with the will to live and the helicopter above. Faith is like the rope: it was always there, and the passenger needs to grab and hang on to it in order to live. A living relationship must be established between sinners and God, our Savior. Jesus saves sinners who are converted by means of faith.

There are many professed Christians who believe the Truth but do not have the life-giving union with Jesus. Through a living faith, they will bear fruit, which is obedience to God’s Word.
