**Introduction**: Romans 9

**Just and Fair Are His Ways**

“OK, Mum,” replied little Benjamin as he bravely wiped away the tears from his freckled cheeks. He swallowed hard, his big brown eyes filled with unshakable faith in the words of his mother. He stuck out his pinkie finger and with a stammering voice asked, “Do you pinkie promise, Mum?” At the tender age of four, Benjamin understood how sacred a promise is. Imagine the joy in his little heart knowing that a sovereign covenant was made between him and his mom.

He would happily continue with his life knowing that his mom would come through for him. With that said, pause for a moment and imagine another little child coming along to claim the promise that was shared between Benjamin and his mom. Also, imagine the mom actually keeping her end of the promise to the other child as well? Could we then call the mom unfair, because she is making promises to both her child and to another? This is the same question that Paul must have faced when he wrote, “That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed” (Rom. 9:8). Could we, then, call God unfair? I must say that I, too, in that position, would have probably asked this question.

Perhaps we should look at the concept of the “children of the promise” from another perspective. A friend of mine recently joined the great family of Jesus. Seeing the joy in her heart as she discovers more and more about the love of Jesus is so encouraging to me. At that point I realized the promise of salvation was made equally to her as it was to me, a child born into a believing family.

Which leads me to the next, somewhat controversial statement of Paul: “As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated” (verse 13). How can a loving, righteous God actually say this? It is unfair! Are we calling God unfair? Paul does not shy away from this. He goes on to say in verse 14, “What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.” Paul goes out of his way to make it clear that God chose Jacob and rejected Esau apart from anything that they would do, “so that the purpose of God according to election might stand” (verse 11). He explains that as the Sovereign of the universe, God always accomplishes what He purposes to do.

The study of this chapter reveals to us that only God has a perfect plan for His people, and His plan is fair and just.
