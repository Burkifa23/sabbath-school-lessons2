**Introduction**: DECEMBER 23 Gen. 15:6; John 3:18; Rom. 4:3, 22; 2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 22:17

**100 Percent Exchanged**

Calling after midnight, or even calling his teacher at all, wasn’t normal for Jason; but he didn’t know where else to turn. How could he be failing a class in religion? Maybe he could find help. Was it too late? When Mr. Haskel answered, his relaxed and hopeful voice surprised Jason.

“Jason, relax, it’s going to be OK. Look, you just trust me to take care of it. I’ll make sure you pass.”

At this point, Jason has two options: (1) he can take his teacher’s word for it, or (2) he can continue freaking out and probably still fail the test. Like the typical college student, he continued in option 2—worry and stress out. And, for all his worry, the test still came the next morning.

**Seventeen Years Later**

“God, I’m not ready to die. I don’t know what to do,” Jason begged, barely conscious. His tears swelled, wetting his hospital gown and drowning his raspy voice in this last-ditch effort. How could he die from a fight in his own club?

“Son, have peace. It’s going to be OK. Believe in Me and you will be saved.” At this point, Jason has two options: (1) he can take God’s word for it, or (2) he can stay miserable and empty on his deathbed. However, this time Jason didn’t pick the second option.

**Lessons From the Test**

When Jason took the test seventeen years earlier and turned it in, he failed as he had expected. However, the student next to him took the teacher’s advice and asked for help. Mr. Haskel then took out his own personal copy of the test, which had been perfectly filled in, and wrote the student’s name at the top. That student got 100 percent just for trusting the teacher, while Jason failed.

As we start our Christian walk, we must first see how Jesus treated us. He took our test so that we can pass. And then, in the same way Mr. Haskel wanted his class to learn, Jesus gave us credit for His perfect life—even though we were undeserving. He put our names on His perfect test, with the perfect score. Jason was saved in that hospital bed because He believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness; he passed the most important test.
