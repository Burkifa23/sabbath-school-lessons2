**Introduction**: Eph. 6:11

**Which Side?**

It poses a challenge to Christians that, instead of pressing God to be on our side, our prayer should be to remain on God’s side at all costs. We live in a world in which we face many challenges. The world wants us to do things in a certain way. Our heavenly Father also wants us to follow His divine instructions.

In Ephesians 6:11, Paul urges Christians to “put on the whole armor of God” (NKJV) so they can stand strong against worldly powers. Like our earthly parents, God is our Father. If we are on the side of our parents, we will do everything they want us to do. In addition to loving them, we will appreciate them, have confidence in them, respect them, and follow their counsel.

Guided by the Holy Spirit, Paul knew the challenges that Christians faced during his time. He echoed a similar message to the church in Rome when he wrote, “And do not be conformed to this world” (Rom. 12:2, NKJV).

These messages remain relevant to us in the twenty-first century. Satan is still the pioneer of darkness, the prince of the world. On the other hand, God remains a loving Father, ever willing and ready to save His children from the jaws of the enemy. He has demonstrated His love for humanity by offering Christ as the ultimate sacrifice for the sake of our salvation (John 3:16).

To be on God’s side, we must do our part. What this means is that we emulate Paul’s teaching and embrace the counsel of God—as it is revealed in His Word. The way we live our lives must conform to the teachings of the Bible. The way we eat, the way we relate to people, the clothes we wear, and everything we do must draw from the template that God provides in His Word. What this means is that we remain obedient to our Father in heaven.

This week, we learn about what we, as Christians, should do to remain obedient to God’s instructions. As we discuss the lesson, we shall learn various ways to improve our works, so our faith in God can be complete. This, in the end, will help us overcome evil with good.
