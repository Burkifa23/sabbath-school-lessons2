#### A Changed Life: Part 2

Monsurat didn’t tell her friends where she went on Saturdays, but they noticed changes in her. She had become more responsible and wasn’t the first one to suggest mischief. When vacation came, Monsurat attended her neighbor’s church. Her parents noticed she was going out on Saturdays and asked where she was going, but Monsurat evaded answering.

When the family went to the mosque to pray, Monsurat went as well.Instead of reciting the prayers she had learned long ago, she prayed in her heart to Jesus. Her mother noticed that she wasn’t reciting the prayers and asked why. Monsurat decided that she should no longer hide her faith from her parents. She would be honest and tell them she had become a Christian. 

Her parents became angry. They forbade her to speak to her Christian neighbor or attend church. They urged her friends and teachers to do what they could to force her to renounce her Christian faith. But, as much as Monsurat wanted to obey her parents, she refused to give up her Jesus. 

Finally, Monsurat’s father told her that she was no longer his daughter. She had to leave the house, and he wouldn’t pay for the two remaining years of her high school education.

Monsurat was terrified of being on her own. But she prayed, and God’s peace flooded over her. She claimed Psalm 27:10 as her hope: “Though my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will receive me” (NIV). Church members helped Monsurat pay her school fees, and a friend who lived near her school let her live with her. 

Monsurat often tried talking to her parents, but they refused to listen. She felt very lonely. Church members visited Monsurat’s family, pleading with her parents to let their daughter return home. Finally, her parents allowed Monsurat to return.

But things didn’t go well, and Monsurat realized she could not continue living at home. She asked a church elder what to do, and he suggested that she apply to study at the Seventh-day Adventist university in Nigeria. There she could live and study in peace. The church would sponsor her and pay her fees.

Monsurat enrolled at Babcock University to study nursing. Her parents are now proud of what she has achieved, and they even visited her a few times while she was at Babcock. Monsurat prays that one day her family will accept Jesus and says that she hopes her story will help other young people to stand firm in their faith.
