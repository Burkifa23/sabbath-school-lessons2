#### God Is a Faithful Husband: Part 1

My husband died suddenly when I was 28, leaving me alone with five young children, no income, no home, no job, and many bills. I was so discouraged that I asked God to let me die, too. 

I’m Elise Gwet, and I live in Cameroon in western Africa. My husband and I attended evangelistic meetings together and agreed that the Seventh-day Adventist Church is God’s true church, that it teaches the truths of the Bible. He joined the Adventist Church at that time, but I didn’t because I was concerned about my family’s reaction. For one year I resisted my husband’s gentle pleading and the Holy Spirit’s call and continued attending my family’s church on Sunday. 

But God was speaking to me, and my husband gently led me. Together they touched my heart. My husband didn’t deal harshly with the children or me because we weren’t worshiping with him. When I cooked unclean food, he didn’t become angry but would quietly tell me that he didn’t eat these foods. He never forced the Sabbath on me but encouraged me to finish the housework, shopping, and cooking on Friday. He wanted me to rest on Sabbath even if I didn’t go to church. My husband won me to the church through his actions and his love. 

I eventually began attending church with him. His attitude and the Holy Spirit worked together to convict me of my errors. Members of the Adventist church also were praying for me. They came and visited me, and prayed and sang with me. I was impressed by their actions, too, and could no longer resist. 

One Sabbath morning, I surprised my husband and told him that I and the children were going to church with him. He was so happy! When we arrived at church, the members were excited to see us. I began studying in the baptismal class and made my decision to be baptized. 

On my baptism day, my husband said his joy was complete. He had a faithful wife, a strong faith, and at last the family was united in the truth. That day he said that if anything happened to separate us, if he should die someday, he hoped I would be faithful to God and the church. But what could happen? I wondered. The family was healthy; we had a home and food. What could go wrong?
