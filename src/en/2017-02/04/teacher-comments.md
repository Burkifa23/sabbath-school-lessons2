#### **Learning Cycle**

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: 1 Peter 2:13–15

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: If we follow the example of Jesus, as well as that of other godly examples from Scripture, we will find that God has established various levels of authority to which we are asked to submit as appropriate, according to His will (1 Pet. 2:15) and “for the Lord’s sake” (1 Pet. 2:13). (Paul gives very similar instruction in Romans 13, Ephesians 5:21–6:9, and Colossians 3:18–4:1.) The believer is expected to model good conduct to the glory of God by submitting to the established authorities, whether in civil government, in work relationships, or in the home and church.

**Just for Teachers**: As the lesson topic is explored, it would be helpful to study the parallels noted above in Paul’s writings for the purpose of seeing the big canonical picture. Romans 13:2 speaks very severely about those who reject the authority that God has established and how they will be judged (compare with 2 Pet. 2:9, 10; Jude 6, 8). The class should discuss the ramifications of these counsels for all human relationships.

**Opening Activity and Discussion**: Have the class read together 1 Peter 2:13–15 and Romans 13:1–5. Discuss the parallels between these two passages and how they support and enhance each other. In what various ways do they introduce God and His will into the picture? Do these passages give blanket authority to individuals, or is the authority vested in the offices or positions they hold? Explain. To what higher authority are these individuals, in turn, expected to be in submission?


#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**:

Compare 1 Peter 2:16 with Galatians 5:13. What point are these two passages making? What danger is there in thinking we are free from all restraint or law? See 2 Peter 2:18–20. Discuss with the class Paul’s argument in Romans 6:15–22 about the benefits of being a slave to righteousness as opposed to being a slave to sin. How does this line of reasoning play into the larger discussion in 1 Peter 2 about submitting to authority? Why does Peter end verse 16, which begins with “Live as free people” (NIV), by saying, “Live as God’s slaves”? How should we understand this antinomy (an apparent contradiction between two equally valid principles that seem to say dissimilar things)?

### **Bible Commentary**

**I. Employee-Employer Relationships** (Review 1 Peter 2:18–20 with your class.)

After discussing submission to authority, in general, especially civil authority, Peter turns to the issue of servant-master relationships, which speaks to modern employer-employee relationships. The term doulos includes a variety of servant, or slave, functions but most commonly refers to an individual working to pay off a debt. In any case, the doulos owed loyalty, respect, and faithful service to the master for whom he or she worked. What the master was due was based not on how well the servant was treated but on the authority of the master and on the responsibility of the servant to submit to that authority. Submitting, despite harsh treatment, was considered commendable because it showed a consciousness of God as the ultimate Master or Authority (compare with Eph. 6:5–9).

**Consider This**: What effect will my relationship with my employer have on those who are observing my daily conduct as a believer?

**II. The Example of Christ** (Review 1 Peter 2:21–25 with your class.)

Peter insists that those of his readers who have endured suffering for doing good have been called to follow in the example of Christ, who suffered for them while doing good. “ ‘He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth’” (1 Pet. 2:22, NIV). Peter here quotes from Isaiah 53:9 as evidence that Christ was doing good, adding, “When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly” (1 Pet. 2:23, NIV). Then Peter borrows again from the Messianic prophecy in Isaiah 53, concluding in verse 24 of his epistle, “ ‘He himself bore our sins’ in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; ‘by his wounds you have been healed’ ” (NIV).

The substitutionary sacrifice that Jesus made for us places on us an obligation to behave with humility as He did and with readiness to suffer for doing what is right. Peter’s rationale, in 1 Peter 2:25, explains that although in the past we were like sheep going astray, that we now have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls, and we have an obligation to follow in His steps, just as sheep do when they have meaningful relationships with the shepherd.

**Consider This**: Jesus endured suffering by maintaining His focus on the goal (Heb. 12:2). What goal can help us to successfully endure as He endured?

**III. Spousal Relationships** (Review together 1 Peter 3:1–7.)

Continuing the theme of submission to established authority, Peter now addresses wives, enjoining them to be submissive to their husbands. This counsel is similar to that given by Paul in Ephesians 5:22–33 and in Colossians 3:18, 19. Only here, Peter explicitly includes wives with unbelieving husbands, which broadens the application even further. He argues that husbands who are unbelievers may be won over to Christ, without a word, by their wives’ good behavior and the purity and reverence of their lives (1 Pet. 3:1, 2).

Peter goes on to discuss the beauty of Christian character—“a gentle and quiet spirit” (1 Pet. 3:3, 4, NIV)—that wives should demonstrate, as opposed to external display of decorative hair, clothing, and jewelry. Then he cites the example of “holy women of the past” (1 Pet. 3:5, NIV), such as Sarah, who were deferential to their husbands and obeyed them, showing respect by doing what was right (1 Pet. 3:6). Finally, Peter addresses husbands who, “in the same way,” are to be considerate of their wives, treating them “[with great gentleness and tact, and with an intelligent regard for the marriage relationship], as with someone physically weaker, since she is a woman. Show her honor and respect as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered or ineffective” (1 Pet. 3:7, AMP).

**Consider This**: The expression “weaker vessel” (ESV, KJV), in verse 7 of some translations, does not refer to physical or emotional weakness. It refers to finely made dishware. Very likely it is a reference to how men should treat women, behaving toward them as they would a valuable piece of china, which should be handled with great care and regard lest it be broken needlessly. The expression is a positive assessment of the value of the wife and the considerate and gentle manner in which she should be treated. How do we assess the value of women in our lives?

**Discussion Questions**:

1. How should we show honor for civil authorities who may not be behaving as they ought in harmony with the principles of doing good and punishing wrongdoing?
2. Why is it not legitimate to use 1 Peter 2:18–20 to attempt to justify slavery?
3. What specifics does Peter address in his discussion of husband-wife relationships?

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: When Peter says in 1 Peter 2:17, “Show proper respect to everyone” (NIV), he identifies three specific groups other than the servants and masters and husbands and wives whom he subsequently addresses directly. These are the family (of believers), the emperor, and God. God is at the very highest level and is to be feared or shown due respect and reverence, which would include worship. The emperor, or king (KJV), is representative of the highest level of authority on earth, and he is to be honored above other civil authorities. The family of believers is all those who are on an equal ground with ourselves, for in Christ “there is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one” (Gal. 3:28, NIV). We are to love this church family with the self-sacrificing love (agap-e) of God and of Christ. How does this instruction encapsulate Peter’s intent?

**Thought Questions**:

1. Why is it important for the believing employee to submit with all due respect to the boss or employer—even one who is harsh and unjust, as well as to the one who is good and considerate?
2. How do I behave if I sense that I have been called to follow in the footsteps of Jesus in suffering for doing what is right?
3. How do I focus on having a beautiful character rather than on external adornment? How did the holy women of the past make themselves beautiful, according to Peter?

**Activity**: Have the class discuss the specifics of Christ’s suffering for the sake of righteousness and the ways in which we can follow in His footsteps.

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: In Paul’s discussion of submission to one another (Eph. 5:21–6:9), all four examples of how one submits involve relationships in which submission is one way and nonreciprocal: wives to husbands, the church to Christ, children to parents, and servants or slaves to masters. Husbands are never commanded to submit to wives, nor Christ to the church, nor parents to children, nor masters to servants. Authority and submission work only in one direction. This principle pervades Scripture, and it reaches into heaven (1 Cor. 11:3) and, in some ways, into eternity (1 Cor. 15:28).

**Activity**: Have the class create a chart representing relationships from Scripture that involve authority and submission, including relationships within humanity, between earth and heaven, and within the heavenly family. Note biblical passages that identify these relationships. Observe how they fit into the pattern of relationships as identified by Peter in this week’s lesson.
