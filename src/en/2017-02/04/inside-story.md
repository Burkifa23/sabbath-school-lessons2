#### A Changed Life: Part 1

Monsurat, a teen from Nigeria, was curious about her neighbor. He didn’t go to the mosque on Friday, and he seemed so happy. She wondered what made him so different. She greeted him when she saw him on the street and watched as he worked around his home. Finally, she found the courage to ask him the question that had burned in her heart: “What religion do you follow?”

“I’m a Seventh-day Adventist,” he replied. Monsurat had never heard of Adventists. He offered her a book, Steps to Christ, and Monsurat accepted it. When she was alone, she took out the book and began reading it. Although her parents couldn’t read, Monsurat knew that they would be angry if they knew she had a Christian book; so, she kept it hidden. 

Monsurat studied in a boarding school and enjoyed it very much. Soon, she forgot about the neighbor with the strange religion. But when Monsurat returned home for a long vacation, she remembered her neighbor and greeted him. One day he invited her to visit his church. 

“I can’t go,” Monsurat said, genuinely sorry. “I have special classes on Saturday to prepare for my high school exams.” She saw the disappointment in her neighbor’s eyes. “Wait,” she said. “I want to see what your church is like. Where is it?” The man told her where the church was located. That Saturday Monsurat prepared for her class but went to the neighbor’s church instead. She was curious to see if the other people in the church were as kind as he was. 

The church members welcomed her warmly. She enjoyed the service, even though it was very different from the religious services she was used to. Every week Monsurat dressed for class but went to church instead. Because church ended about the same time as her class, her parents never knew. 

Monsurat received a Bible and began reading it. She learned to pray as Christians prayed and asked God to help her live a good life. She had been somewhat mischievous, but she was determined that her teachers and dean would see a different person when she returned to school.

Back at school, Monsurat discovered an Adventist church an hour away by bus. She got up early on Saturday morning to catch the bus. She spent most of the day with the church members and returned to school in the evening. Before the year ended, Monsurat gave her life to Christ and asked to be baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
