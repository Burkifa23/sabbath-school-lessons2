#### The Miracle Bible

I was packed and ready to leave for the military. My father put his hand on my shoulder and handed me a Bible to take along.

“I’ll be faithful to God,” I promised my father. I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but I was determined to try. 

I joined the other recruits, and we started marching toward the basic training camp. The commander made the march as difficult as possible. We had to cross a river on our hands and knees, and when it became very deep, we had to swim with our heavy packs on. 

When we crawled out on the other side our bags were soaking wet, but we were given no chance to rest or dry out. We continued marching at a rapid pace. As soon as we arrived at the camp, we were given other exercises to do. It was late at night before we had time to unpack our wet bags.

Pulling out my clothes and other belongings, I wrung river water out of each item and laid them out to dry. Then my eyes fell on the Bible from my father. I groaned, sure it would be ruined from the water. But as I touched it, it felt dry. Surprised, I pulled it out of the bag. It was dry. Everything in my bag was soaked with dirty water—except for the Bible. It was clean and dry. I was reminded that God was with me. 

During the rigors of basic training, however, I sometimes forgot the beautiful evidence of God’s presence. I wanted to keep the Sabbath, but it was difficult. I prayed that God would help me find a way.

Then I learned that the military was looking for soldiers to teach military children. I immediately signed up. Thankfully, I was chosen to teach, so I didn’t have to work on Sabbath.

While in the military, I often shared my faith. My roommate talked to me about the Bible; he said he saw something different in me. He accepted my invitation to attend some evangelistic meetings and later gave his life to Jesus. 

Another soldier was a Muslim; his father didn’t want him to become a Christian. But he had attended Seventh-day Adventist schools and was ready to take a stand for Christ. We talked a lot about God, and eventually he became an Adventist.

I knew that God was with me. He had kept my Bible dry on the first day of training, and He had made it possible for me to keep the Sabbath and lead others to Him, even while serving in the military.
