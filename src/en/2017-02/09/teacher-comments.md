#### **Learning Cycle**

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: 2 Peter 1:2–4

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: It is possible to become partakers of the divine nature and to escape the corruption that is in the world by way of evil desires. It is possible to achieve assurance of success in the Christian life and to be welcomed into the eternal kingdom of our Lord.

In our passage, Peter tells us how we can accomplish all these goals. We must have an effective and productive knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ—who called us to emulate His holiness (compare with 1 Pet. 1:15, 16). After describing the ladder of Christian virtues, Peter says, “For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ” (2 Pet. 1:8, NIV). Through the divine power made available in the precious promises of His Word, God permits us to become partakers of the divine nature and to escape the corrupt natures we have inherited in this world. Thus, He fits us for eternity.

**Just for Teachers**: It is important that all of the proper connections within this passage be made lest class members conclude that it is a matter of working their ways up the ladder of Christian virtues, rung by rung, until they achieve success through their own efforts. While it is true that Peter says, “Make every effort to add . . .” (2 Pet. 1:5, NIV), he is not encouraging his readers to attempt to climb the ladder on their own or to conclude that God grants them any merit based on their efforts. He begins the discussion, in verse 3, by reminding the reader, “[God’s] divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life” (NIV). Peter adds that, by God’s own glory and goodness, “he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature” and escape the world’s corruption (2 Pet. 1:4, NIV). Everything good is a gift from God, but we need to exercise our power of choice by being eager to make our calling and election sure (1 Pet. 1:10).

**Opening Activity and Discussion**: Have the class read together 2 Peter 1:2–4. Discuss the divinely appointed elements Peter mentions to achieve spiritual victory.

#### STEP 2—Explore

### **Bible Commentary**

**I. The Centrality of Jesus Christ (Review 2 Peter 1:1, 2 with your class.)**

As Peter begins his second epistle, he continues his emphasis on the centrality of Jesus Christ that we saw in his first epistle. In the first 15 verses that we will be studying this week, there are six explicit references to Jesus Christ, usually either as Lord or as God, plus many other references to Him through the use of personal pronouns. In verse 1, through a Greek grammatical construction, Jesus is called both our God and Savior. In verses 2, 8, 11, and 14, Jesus is designated as our Lord. In all but verse 2, He is called Jesus Christ, or Jesus the Messiah. In verse 11, He is our Lord and Savior. Clearly, Peter has a very high Christology and wants to communicate this interpretation to his readers. He is proud to bear the name that Jesus gave him, Simon Peter (“the rock”) and to be a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ (2 Pet. 1:1).

**Consider This**: Which aspects of Jesus’ person and work are especially important for my life? In what ways can I make Him the center of my daily life?

**II. The Gifts of God’s Grace (Review 2 Peter 1:3, 4 with your class.)**

Everything we need for life and godliness has been given to us by God’s divine power through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness. According to 2 Peter 1:2, grace and peace are ours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. According to verse 8, we need to be kept from being ineffective and unproductive in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Peter also calls us to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It seems that, to Peter, the knowledge of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior is key to our successful growth as Christians. God also has given to us very great and precious promises. Through believing in these promises, we can become partakers of the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world by way of the evil desires that the sinful nature produces. The power is in the promise (Rom. 4:21).

**Consider This**: In what ways are the grace and power of God through Jesus Christ being manifested in my daily life? How have I experienced the power found in the promises?

**III. The Ladder of Christian Virtues (Review together 2 Peter 1:5–11.)**

Here Peter identifies the qualities a Christian must acquire and practice in order to be effective and productive in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. Those who remember that they have been cleansed from their sins (2 Pet. 1:9) and who are eager to make their calling and election sure (2 Pet. 1:10) will develop these traits in increasing measure (2 Pet. 1:8). Then they can be assured that they will never fall (2 Pet. 1:10) and that they “will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Pet. 1:11, NIV). Invite the class to spend some time reviewing these virtues. Discuss the interrelationship between them that forms a “ladder” of sorts, leading to upward growth and progress.

**Consider This**: How many virtues in Peter’s list are evident in my daily life? In what ways am I growing or stagnating?

**Discussion Questions**:

1. How does Peter’s catalog of virtues compare with Paul’s list of the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22, 23? In what ways can we exemplify these qualities of growing Christians?
2. What does Peter mean by “the tent of this body” (2 Pet. 1:13, NIV)? Compare 2 Corinthians 5:1–4. What does this text tell us about his view of the nature of humanity?

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Some Seventh-day Adventists believe that at the end of time there will be a group of believers who will achieve a level of perfection that is absolute. Others believe that the perfection to be achieved is relative, speaking of maturity in faith and practice rather than of absolute perfection. Ellen G. White says, regarding Christ’s injunction in Matthew 5:48 to be perfect, “We may be as perfect in our sphere as God is in His sphere.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 455. This statement suggests relative or moral character perfection (see Christ’s Object Lessons, pp. 330, 331). Nevertheless, it would be wise not to get sidetracked. There is nothing in 2 Peter 1:8–11 that speaks of absolute perfection; only of victory and assurance. Maintain the focus of the text.

**Thought Questions**:

1. What biblical promises have I found to be powerful aids in dealing with the corruption that is in the world by way of evil desires?
2. Where do I find myself on the ladder of Christian virtues? In what ways am I still growing?

**Activity**: Have the class read together 2 Peter 1:8–11. Discuss the implications (as identified in 2 Peter 1:8, 9) of having the qualities in 2 Peter 1:5–7 versus not having them. Why would it be important to demonstrate an eagerness to make one’s calling and election sure?

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: There is a fine balance between assurance and self-confidence in one’s salvation. Ellen G. White warns, “Those who accept Christ, and in their first confidence say, I am saved, are in danger of trusting to themselves. They lose sight of their own weakness and their constant need of divine strength. They are unprepared for Satan’s devices, and under temptation many, like Peter, fall into the very depths of sin. We are admonished, ‘Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.’ 1 Cor. 10:12. Our only safety is in constant distrust of self, and dependence on Christ.”—Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 155.

**Activity**: Take a poll of the class by secret ballot (so as to maintain confidentiality) in order to determine (1) how many have assurance of salvation and (2) what they understand to be the basis for their assurance (or lack of assurance). Discuss the results with the class.
