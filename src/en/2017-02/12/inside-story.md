#### Mother of Many: Part 2

Every week, we talked about God and read from the Bible. We prayed together, and then we ate. At first, I think they listened just to be polite and get a hot meal. But as time went by, they became more interested in what I was trying to teach them.

Soon the boys were treating me like a mother, confiding in me and trusting me. Some of them told me about their desire to get rid of their drug habits or about things they had stolen. I listened and counseled them about how to live a happy, honest life instead. I told them about the joys of hard work and honest labor. I told them about people in the Bible and how they resisted temptation and followed God’s plan, often changing the world around them. The boys listened and were inspired to trust God to change them. I encouraged the ones who had parents to return home to their families. It took a lot of talking, but eventually some decided to go home.

One boy, Pierre, had run away from home when he was only seven years old. He had lost some money he was supposed to take to his mother, and he was afraid of being punished. So, he ran away. Eventually he arrived in the capital city, where he lived on the streets for the next eight years. After I told him the story of the prodigal son, Pierre agreed to return home. But he was afraid to go by himself. So, I agreed to go with him. 

We went to the bus station together and bought tickets to his hometown. When we arrived, we walked down almost forgotten streets until he found his house. His mother stared at the tall young man standing in front of her, unable to tell that this was the little boy she had lost so long ago. She thought her son was dead. She stared at Pierre for a long minute. When her mind at last grasped whom she was seeing, she threw her arms around him and hugged him tightly, weeping for joy. Then she began calling her neighbors to see her son, who had been lost but had come home. That night there was joy in one home over a lost child who had returned. 

I stayed in Pierre’s town overnight so I could take him to visit the local pastor. I explained that Pierre had recently accepted Jesus as his Savior and returned to his mother’s house. He would need lots of nurturing.
