### _The Lesson in Brief_

**Key Texts**: Luke 5:1–11

#### **The Student Will:**
- **Know:** Recognize his or her own inadequacy while trusting in Jesus’ power to accomplish His mission.
- **Feel:** Experience gratitude for the privilege of being called by Jesus to work for Him, despite a sense of unworthiness to be in close relationship with Him.
- **Do:** Respond to Jesus’ call to become a fisher of men and women, children and youth, willing to leave everything to follow Him.

#### **Learning Outline:**
1. Know: Jesus Calls for Coworkers in the “Fishing” Business. 
   + **A** What makes us worthy to become coworkers with Jesus?
   + **B** Where does the power come from for bringing souls into the gospel net? How do we connect to the Source of that power?
2. Feel: Unworthy Sinners, Yet Grateful and Obedient
   + **A** In what ways do we sense our unworthiness as sinners to be in close relationship with Jesus?
   + **B** How can we express gratitude for the privilege of being called to become coworkers with Christ?
3. Do: Answering His Call
   + **A** Why is it important when we heed Christ’s call to recognize that it is His sufficiency, not our own, that will grant success in His mission?
   + **B** Why must we leave everything in order to follow Jesus and fulfill His mission for souls?
 
**Summary:** Peter’s life was dramatically transformed when he realized his true condition as a sinner in the presence of Christ. Peter rendered willing obedience to Jesus’ commands and witnessed the power of Christ to accomplish His mission independently of his skills as a professional fisherman. Peter learned that he must trust Christ’s sufficiency alone.

#### **Learning Cycle**
------

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Matthew 14:25–33

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Trusting in our own sufficiency leads to danger and despair. Once Peter realizes that his only hope is in Christ and calls out to Him for help, he is able to conquer the waves of despair that threaten his life and soul. Jesus still asks of us, as He did that day of Peter, “ ‘Why did you doubt?’ ” (Matt. 14:31, NKJV). As the disciples did, we need to respond in worship, saying, “ ‘Truly You are the Son of God’ ” (Matt. 14:33, NKJV).

Other experiences from the life of Peter also reveal his ongoing struggle with self-sufficiency and his slowness to learn the lesson that Christ tried to teach him. Only when he is humbled and broken after his denial of Jesus is he fully converted. It is then that he submits completely to the sufficiency of Christ, ready to become an instrument in Christ’s hands for the fulfillment of His mission.

**Just for Teachers**: The goal of this lesson is to lead the class to distrust their own sufficiency and to learn to rely on Christ’s sufficiency. 

**Opening Activity and Discussion**: Have the class read Matthew 14:25–33. Discuss the setting in which this event takes place (Matt. 14:13–24) and what Peter should have taken away from these events. Ask the class to consider events in their lives that have tended to lead to self-confidence. Invite them to recall how things turned out before they surrendered themselves to Christ’s leadership and power in their lives. Based on subsequent events in Peter’s life, how effectively does he learn his lesson here? How effectively do we learn the lesson of trusting Christ’s power and sufficiency in our early experiences? Why does Jesus not give up on us just because we don’t learn the first time around?

#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**:

Several important points are developed in Luke 5:1–11 that need to be emphasized to the students. Whom Jesus calls He equips; the power is from Him. The men He calls are professional fishermen, but He calls them to become apprentice fishers of people, a task for which they are ill-equipped. Jesus provides the evidence that He is the professional at fishing. If those whom He calls trust in Him rather than in their own methods, He will provide them with a successful catch. They need to acknowledge His deity and their unworthiness. They also need to leave their own tools and methods behind in order to follow Him in humble obedience to His calling and equipping.

### **Bible Commentary**

1. **The Call to Service** (Review Luke 5:1–11 with your class.)

As a professional fisherman, Peter lives his life on the water. He knows what it takes to catch fish, or so he believes. He also knows that people don’t walk on water. Jesus overturns all of Peter’s knowledge and self-sufficiency. To catch fish effectively one needs to have power over nature. Only Jesus has that power. He demonstrates it by filling Peter’s nets with an overwhelming catch of fish after Peter toils all night without catching anything. (Later, Jesus also demonstrates His power again by walking on water.) Peter needs to recognize and acknowledge Jesus’ deity and his own unworthiness so that he might work in association with Him (Luke 5:8). Peter also needs to learn to trust Jesus when He issues a command or instruction, because the Savior always knows exactly what He is doing and has the power to execute His own will. Peter also needs to leave behind all of his own tools and methods to follow Jesus, apprenticed to the Master Fisher of men and women (Luke 5:10, 11).

Consider This: How successful have we been at fishing for souls on our own, using purely human methods? How much more successful would we be if we trusted Christ’s methods and power, and why?

2. **The Call to Confess Christ** (Review Matthew 16:13–19 with your class.)

Jesus invites His disciples to confess their awareness of His identity (“ ‘Who do you say I am?’ ” [Matt. 16:15, NIV]). Peter, ever the brash spokesperson for the others, expresses his confession that Jesus is the Christ (Messiah), the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:16). Jesus declares that Peter could have known this truth only by revelation from the Father (Matt. 16:17). This acknowledgment is no credit to Peter, but it underscores the necessity for divine insight in coming to such a conclusion. Unfortunately, Peter seems to have become more confident of, and reliant on, his own correct understanding of Christ and His mission (Matt. 16:21–23).

**Consider This**: How can we be certain that we know Christ’s true identity as Messiah? How can we attain a more intimate knowledge of Him and what He is able to accomplish in our lives?
 
3. **The Call to Humility** (Review Matthew 16:21–23 with your class.)

As Jesus attempts to explain His mission to His disciples, Peter rebukes Jesus: “ ‘Never, Lord! . . . This shall never happen to you!’ ” (Matt. 16:22, NIV). Peter’s self-confident attitude is sharply reproved by Jesus as being expressive of the spirit of Satan. What does Jesus mean when He says to Peter, “ ‘You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns’ ” (Matt. 16:23, NIV)? What does Peter seem to have in mind in his rebuke to Jesus? How can we develop a more humble, self-effacing attitude? What does 1 Peter 5:5, 6 reveal that has helped Peter eventually to learn of the importance of humility?

**Consider This**: In what ways do our expectations of Jesus correspond to His own sense of identity and mission? How do we know when we are ready to learn the lesson of humility?

4. **The Call to Faithfulness** (Review together Matthew 26:31–35, 69–75; Luke 22:31–34.)

After three and a half years with Jesus, Peter still has not learned his lesson. Peter first denies Jesus’ prediction that all would forsake Him and flee, insisting that he never would do that. Then he denies Jesus Himself, insisting that he does not know Him. When Peter realizes that Jesus knows him better than he knows himself, he finally submits himself fully to God and allows God’s Spirit to control him. This full surrender results in his conversion, placing him in a position to become a spiritual leader for Jesus’ church and the writer of the two epistles that encourage others to be faithful to Jesus.

It is interesting to note that, after Peter has been active as a church leader and apostle for many years, he still exhibits some weaknesses for which he is reproved, according to Paul, in Galatians 2:11–14. Ellen G. White writes concerning this incident: “Peter saw the error into which he had fallen, and immediately set about repairing the evil that had been wrought, so far as was in his power. God, who knows the end from the beginning, permitted Peter to reveal this weakness of character in order that the tried apostle might see that there was nothing in himself whereof he might boast. Even the best of men, if left to themselves, will err in judgment.”—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 198.

#### Discussion Questions: 

`How does Peter’s experience in these events of Matthew 26 and Luke 22 prepare his understanding for writing his two epistles?`

`In what ways do we identify with Peter’s self-confidence and assertiveness? What will need to happen to us to bring our self-confidence under submission in order that we may learn at the Master’s feet?`

`What role does Jesus’ prayer for Peter (Luke 22:32) play in his conversion? How does this prayer enable Peter to strengthen his brethren through the writing of his two epistles? How does knowing that Jesus has prayed for us (John 17:20) offer us encouragement and hope?`

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Remind the class that Peter’s experience is not unique to him. He is just bolder and more outspoken in asserting himself in various situations than are his fellow disciples; so he receives more attention in the Gospels. None of the disciples understand what Jesus tells them about His mission (Luke 9:44, 45). Just as Elijah (James 5:17), they are human beings sharing the same weaknesses that we all do and needing the same divine power for victory over those weaknesses.

**Thought Questions**: 

`What do I have in common with Peter? What is my potential for good or evil?`

`How can I be strengthened by recalling that Jesus is praying for me, so that when I am converted I can, in turn, strengthen my brothers and sisters?`

**Activity**: Have the class consider praying specifically for those in the church, including their own members who may be struggling with Satan’s temptations. Encourage one another to faithfulness.

**Alternate Activity**: Discuss with the class the call to discipleship (fishing for people) that Jesus makes to Peter, Andrew, James, and John in Luke 5:1–11 (compare with Matt. 4:18–22). Plan a class project that would involve attracting people into the gospel net.

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: We have an opportunity here to relate to Peter’s life and experience. Note the ways in which Jesus reaches out to encourage Peter rather than to criticize him for his failures, even in the midst of predicting some of them. What experiences can class members cite as evidence that Jesus is there to encourage them, despite their frequent failures?

**Activity**: Create a chart, if supplies are available, of the ups and downs, the successes and failures, in Peter’s life, as recorded in the New Testament. Alternately, if supplies are not available, ask the class to list these aspects of Peter’s life. What pattern emerges? What relation does the pattern have to Peter’s conversion experience? How is this instructive for us?
