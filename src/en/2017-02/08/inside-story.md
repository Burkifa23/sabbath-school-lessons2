#### God Is a Faithful Husband: Part 3

Through the years, God has given me special evidences of His love. Long before I married, I heard a young man play the piano. I was so impressed that I told God that if I had children, I would want them to learn to play the piano for His glory. God answered that prayer. My daughter is truly a gifted musician. I could never afford piano lessons, but she has a natural musical ability. She has a friend who owns a piano, and when she visited their home they allowed her to play. She has never had a formal piano lesson, but God has been her teacher. She plays beautifully and has been recognized nationally for her playing, and best of all, she gives God the glory. She plays for the church, and many people come to the church just to hear her play. 

I never had enough money to save for an emergency. Then one day, my son was riding a bicycle and was hit by a driver who fled the scene. Someone brought my son home with injuries to his collarbone and plenty of scrapes and bruises. 

That day my brother-in-law, who is a doctor, had come to visit. Twice he had stood up to leave; then without explanation, he sat down again. He was standing to leave when the people brought my injured son home. My brother-in-law attended to him and took the boy to the hospital. He gave him medical care and even bought the medicines that my son needed. Then he brought my son back home. He told me, “I hadn’t planned to stay long this morning, but something—or Someone—told me to stay. Now I understand that the voice I heard was God’s.”

Yes, I can truly say that God is my husband. He provides for me and cares for me. My children are His, and I give Him all the glory for taking me, a young widow, through a difficult time into victory in His name. To God be the glory.
