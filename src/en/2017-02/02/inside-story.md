#### The Canceled Funeral: Part 2

Everyone in the room heard One-Ojo sneeze, too, and they ran outside terrified. I continued praying, and One-Ojo opened her eyes. She struggled to free herself from the ropes that bound her. I called her brother to come and untie the burial ropes. 

When her brother saw One-Ojo struggling, he began shaking with fear. But I urged him to untie his sister. When she was freed, we helped her to a chair. The mourners who had fled now crowded around the doorway and windows to see the dead girl who was now alive.

One-Ojo asked for food, and someone brought it to her. Soon her strength returned, and we praised God together. Then I told the family that God had healed their daughter in answer to prayer, but that God was not willing to share His glory with witchcraft. I warned them not to put herbs on One-Ojo according to their custom, for this was a form of witchcraft, and it would not please God. The girl’s mother and brother nodded in agreement. 

It was dark when I returned to my room. My legs were shaking, and I felt weak and exhausted. I knelt down and prayed, “God, today my ‘Thomas prayer’ has been answered. I believe. Use me as You will. I’m Yours.” Then I fell into bed and slept soundly.

About one o’clock in the morning, a loud knock at my door woke me. “Pastor Larie, come!” a woman’s voice begged. I opened the door and found One-Ojo’s mother standing there. “Come!” she begged. “One-Ojo is dead again.”

“How can that be?” I asked. “God’s power never fails.” I hurried with her to where One-Ojo lay on her bed. I checked her pulse and her breathing. She was dead—again. As I knelt down beside her, I smelled the witch doctor’s herbs that someone had spread on her body.

“Who put those herbs on her body?” I asked. One-Ojo’s mother said that her husband must have done it, for he was the only other person in the house. 

“God raised her from the dead,” I said, “and He deserves the glory for her resurrection. But someone has dishonored God and applied these herbs to her, and now she is dead again!” 

I turned and prayed as the family waited silently. A few minutes later One-Ojo opened her eyes and sat up. I stayed with her a few minutes. Then before I returned home, I warned the family again not to allow anyone to touch her body with the witch doctor’s herbs. Her mother and brother nodded vigorously. Then I went home and fell into bed, exhausted.
