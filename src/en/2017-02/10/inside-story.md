#### Putting God in the Picture

As a professional photographer, I take photographs and videos of weddings and other important occasions. I also film documentaries for television and photograph sporting events.  

When I first became a Seventh-day Adventist, I wondered how I would ever keep the Sabbath. Most of the events that I covered fell on Sabbath, and I had to work these events in order to keep my job. I had a family to support; so, I decided to go to church on Sabbaths when I didn’t have work, but when I had an assignment, I worked.

However, I had no peace about working on the Sabbath. And it seemed that no matter how hard I worked I couldn’t get ahead. Someone in my family would get sick, or we would have other unexpected expenses. I asked the pastors at church to pray for us.

Then God stepped in. The company I was working for was bought by another company, and I lost my job. Almost immediately people began calling me to work as a freelancer. I realized that I could have my own business.

Then I heard a sermon about being faithful to God’s principles no matter what. That sermon pricked my conscience. I knew that God was nudging me to be more faithful to Him. I decided that I wouldn’t take any assignments on the Sabbath. I knew it would be difficult, because most social events occur on the weekends. But I was determined to trust God to supply our needs.

It isn’t always easy. Sometimes we’ve had to ask the landlord for extra time to pay the rent, or think of new ways to make our money stretch. But God is with us.

Just when our financial obligations seemed to overwhelm us, I met a former client on the street. He had owed me money for a long time. We chatted for a few minutes, but neither of us said anything about the money. Then as we prepared to part, he handed me the money he had owed me for years. Several months later, another former client paid me money I had long forgotten and never expected to see.

I don’t earn as much as I did when I worked on Sabbath, but God is blessing in other ways. My children have fewer sicknesses, and we have fewer unexpected bills. I know that we have no need to fear for the future. I try to encourage others to be faithful, and I assure them that God will always provide a way.
