#### The Canceled Funeral—Part 3

I was still sleeping when a knock awakened me at dawn. “Pastor, come. She’s dead again!” One-Ojo’s mother cried. In disbelief, I opened the door and asked what had happened.

“While we slept, her father came home. Maybe he put the herbs on her,” she said. Someone wanted One-Ojo to die. Was it the father? Perhaps it was her mother, too. Should I go back and pray again? Would God be honored? One-Ojo’s mother knelt before me and begged me to come and pray for her daughter. I went. 

Once more I prayed for the girl, and she awoke again. This time I told her mother to take One-Ojo away from the village. Her mother agreed, and One-Ojo’s brother took her to relatives in another village. 

One-Ojo returned home several months later, strong and healthy. She continued her Bible studies and was baptized along with nine other new believers. On her baptismal day, One-Ojo took the name Blessing to signify her new life. Her presence in the village is a testimony to God’s power to save, even from death. Today 70 believers worship in a simple shelter near One-Ojo’s home in central Nigeria. 

The story of One-Ojo spread throughout central Nigeria and opened doors to share God’s love with people in neighboring villages. Many people have come to know Jesus as their friend and Savior because of God’s power in the life of One-Ojo.
