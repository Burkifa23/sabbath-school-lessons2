### The Lesson in Brief

**Key Text**: Galatians 5:13


#### The Student Will:

- **Know**: Discuss how true freedom in Christ escapes both legalism and licentiousness.
- **Feel**: Sense the stirring joy that freedom in Christ brings.
- **Do**: Spring into loving service that is born through faith in the one who is united to Christ.

#### Learning Outline:

1. Know: True Freedom
+ How does faith in Christ set us free? From what and whom are we free?
+ What are we called to do with our freedom?
+ How does our freedom in Christ result in “fulfillment” of the law, as opposed to “doing” the law?

2. Feel: Joyful Freedom
+ How does freedom from bondage to sin, death, and the devil affect our attitudes and relationships to others?
+ How do we express our joy in our worship to the One who freed us and empowers us to live lives of faith?
+ How is joy related to faith?

3. Do: Active Freedom
+ If we are truly free because we are united to Christ through faith, how is our resulting joy and love expressed through service to others?
+ How is our labor of love, which results from our relationship with Christ, different from labor designed to bring us into Christ’s favor?

**Summary**: Freedom born from faith in Christ liberates us from slavery to sin, death, and the devil. We are free to express our faith in Christ through loving and joyful service, thereby fulfilling the law, which enjoins us to “love others as yourself.”

#### Learning Cycle

##### STEP 1—Motivate

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Christ’s sacrifice releases us from bondage to sin so that we freely may choose Christ and His lifestyle.

Countercultural icon Bob Dylan wailed, “You’re gonna have to serve somebody. Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord, but you’re gonna have to serve somebody.” Dylan’s sentiment is correct. While “no man can serve two masters,” everyone serves one. Christian freedom must be understood within this context. There is no spiritual Switzerland—neutral territory inclined neither right nor left. We are on one side or the other in the great controversy. To choose not to choose is to make a choice, the wrong choice. Through His death on the cross, Christ has paved the way for all the world to have salvation, freedom, and victory in Him. Yet, we have to be careful. First, millions of freed slaves willingly have returned to slavery. Christ unlocked the penitentiary, shattering prison gates and destroying prison walls, but many prisoners remained there by choice. Second, others escaped but carried invisible prisons with them. Their prisons consist of doubts, shame, fearfulness, and guilt. They serve God motivated by fear rather than love. They serve Jonathan Edwards’ angry God: “The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked.”—Clyde E. Fant, Jr., and William M. Pinson, Jr., 20 Centuries of Great Preaching (Waco, Tex.: Word Books, 1971), vol. 3, p. 63. Fortunately, millions have also accepted the freedom purchased at the exorbitant price of Christ’s life. Released from guilt, shame, haunting memories, addictions, and self-destructive behaviors, they enjoy the abundant lives provided by their Creator.

**Discuss**: How do we flourish within the context of loving obedience, and revel in the adventure of passionate and compassionate service to God?

##### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: Freedom is simultaneously the world’s greatest blessing and its greatest curse. Freedom must be measured by outcomes. How is freedom exercised? Freedom expresses special privileges or rights of access proceeding from citizenship. What, then, constitutes heavenly citizenship? How are citizenship and freedom acquired or forfeited? What rights and obligations accompany citizenship? How does the believer utilize freedom? What might believers do that would compromise or eventually forfeit their freedoms? How should Christians avoid both legalistic, fear-driven religion, and anything-goes, licentious philosophy? These questions constitute not mere discussion points but critical issues central to emotional stability and abundant living.

**Bible Commentary**

**I. The Nature of Christian Freedom** (Review Romans 6:6, 12 with the class.)

Over the centuries, Jewish religion had become encrusted beneath layers of well-intentioned human tradition. The well-intentioned aspect must not be overlooked, lest modern believers repeat those same mistakes. The first mistake was miscalculating the relationship between worshiper and covenant. Rather than worshiping God motivated by gratitude for redemption and creation, the people offered worship on the foundation of fearful obligation. Their observations were not flawed, but their interpretation was. They observed that whenever the nation lived harmoniously with God’s principles, the nation prospered. They interpreted this as the divine payment for acceptable service. They reasoned that whenever their service became unacceptable, God would withdraw divine favor, and punishment would follow. This thinking produced legalistic mind-sets and practices that destroyed concepts of a loving heavenly Father who desires intimate fellowship with His earthly children. Service was rendered to avoid punishment or to obtain reward. Loving service offered from hearts appreciative for God’s gracious goodness was largely, but not completely, unknown.

Paul’s new covenant message—following Jeremiah’s ancient prophecy of internalized devotion, rooted in love rather than fear—constituted spiritual release for Paul’s contemporaries and Christians of every generation. Christian freedom includes release from base impulses, hereditary tendencies, every kind of temptation, and, naturally, the consequences of indulging those impulses and tendencies. Christ’s indwelling Spirit releases us from both legalism and licentiousness.

**Consider This**: Throughout history sincere attempts have been made to regulate human behavior in order to appease God. Pharisaical regulations governing Sabbath observance were a prime example. These were well-intended and perfectly acceptable as individual expressions of devotion. However, when these personal preferences regarding the allowable Sabbath traveling distance, and so on, became laws restricting others’ choices, they led to legalism. Knowing that every facet of life leads toward or away from God, some well-intentioned modern believers have legislated dress, diet, leisure, and other aspects of living. How should Christians respond to attempts by other Christians to legislate their conduct? How can well-intentioned believers honor their conscientious convictions without trying to impose them upon others? Why might some substitute legislation for prayerful searching of Scripture and confidence in the power of the indwelling Spirit? How might “majoring in minors” compromise our spiritual authority when, at other times, indisputable sinful behavior requires confrontation and correction? How quietly might modeling our understanding of appropriate Christian behavior and passionately loving others be more effective in promoting our views as compared with trying to legislate them?

##### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Christian freedom means receiving a new nature that institutes an internal transformation of behavior rather than an external regulation of behavior. The bicycle’s chain attaches to the rear sprocket and, from the center of the radiating spokes, transfers power that mobilizes the entire bicycle. Some motion could be accomplished by turning the tire outside the rim, but such motion is superficial when compared with the power radiating from the centered sprocket. Civil government does bear some responsibility for regulating society so that such egregious evils as violence, robbery, and so on, will not go unchecked; but history has shown that spiritual revival is exponentially more effective in transforming behavior than is imprisonment and punishment. The Holy Spirit’s power, radiating from the completely surrendered heart, is humanity’s only realistic hope for lasting transformation and survival.

**Activity**: Read the following parable aloud and discuss the implications for making Christian freedom real in the believer’s experience.

**The Airplane’s Soliloquy**

They finally released me from ground school. I’m free to soar, explore, and reach my destiny. Speaking of destinations, I’m free to go anywhere. What an adventure! Think: exotic destinations never even dreamed about before; searching endless horizons, tasting tantalizing sunsets in paradise, navigating the outer limits of known civilization. What possibilities! Maybe I’ll survey Iceland for starters. Of course, the regulatory agency is recommending otherwise because of a volcanic eruption. Some commission decided that it’s dangerous because previous airplanes stalled on microscopic dust found in volcanic clouds. Maybe they’re just saying that to drive people away from the fun. Where’s their proof? It’s just small stuff anyway. How much harm could that be? There are those stories about that small stuff hardening and clogging engines; but just because other airplanes haven’t been able to handle it, doesn’t necessarily mean I’m not built strong enough. Then again, why chance it? Maybe waiting makes sense. There are dozens of other exciting options. Maybe the commission does know what it’s talking about this time. I’m free to travel to Iceland, but there’s Newfoundland, the Pyrenees, the Solomons, plus the Mediterranean. Besides, my manufacturer invested endless hours of research and development to produce me. I’m actually free. That means I can choose.

**Discussion Points**: When Christians utilize freedom, how should they view the small stuff? How could careless self-confidence bring about disaster? How should appreciation for God’s investment in the believer affect his/her attitude about using freedom? How might studying the examples of freedom contained in Scripture help us make profitable decisions?

##### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Despite what we have been given in Christ, somehow the liberated have sided often with their captor rather than their liberator. Christians must counteract this travesty by becoming heaven’s agents, exemplifying lives transformed by divine grace. By becoming examples of properly exercised freedom, believers demonstrate God’s wisdom in liberating prisoners rather than in manufacturing robots to worship Him.

**Activity**: Option A. Invite the class to make lists of choices that they or their friends make that may affect their spirituality. Allow them to reflect openly about how misused freedom could inhibit their growth in these areas. Option B. Study the songs found in the church hymnal. Look for allusions to freedom. Discuss how Christ’s incarnation provided spiritual freedom for His followers. What might the lyrics suggest about how Christians appropriate the freedoms that Jesus purchased at such a high price?
