#### Joy in the Morning: Part 2

That evening the pastor and his wife visited Mary’s house, but Mary wasn’t home. Her husband, Samy, was sitting outside the house alone. He told them that he and Mary had fought that afternoon over money. Samy told the whole story—and that they were planning to commit suicide.

Samy shared that while they had attended church for festivals, they had never felt God’s presence. He had made statues of saints for the church, but no more were needed, so he had no work.

The pastor and his wife listened intently. Gently but urgently they encouraged Samy that suicide was not the way out. They invited Samy to trust God, to give Him a chance. Samy was so distressed that he knew no other solution. He wanted to know what hope the pastor and his wife lived by. They talked together for three hours, showing Samy God’s love from the Bible. Samy was full of questions about God and His love. The pastor offered to pray for Samy and Mary, and especially that Samy would find work. When the couple finally stood to leave, Samy begged them to return the next day.

When the pastor returned the next evening, Mary was there with the children. Samy was smiling broadly. He could hardly wait to tell the pastor that a contractor had come that morning and asked him to work! Mary was smiling for the first time in weeks. They seemed to be a totally different couple from the two distressed people the pastor had met on Sabbath.

The next time the pastor visited, Mary greeted him excitedly. “Daniel’s fever is gone! And he’s coughing less.” Within a few days he was playing and eating like a normal boy.

Madesh and the pastor and his wife continued visiting the family. They saw remarkable changes. This family, who had fought constantly and threatened to commit suicide, were now praying and reading the Bible together. When the pastor studied with the couple, they often invited neighbors to listen. Sometimes there were 25 people waiting for the Bible study.

Three months later, Mary and Samy were baptized. They invited their friends to come, and a few months later six friends were baptized. The couple rejoice that since the prayers of faithful Seventh-day Adventists, Samy has never been out of work. Every week, the couple gladly brings 100 rupees in tithe and offerings to thank God for His blessing.
