#### Match Made in Heaven: Part 2

The next day Marina brought some material for Sahana to read. As Sahana read the material, she was amazed at how clear Daniel and Revelation became. Later Marina brought her The Desire of Ages to read. Sahana read it through swiftly, feeling the Holy Spirit impress her that this was the truth.

Sahana wanted to visit the Seventh-day Adventist church and see for herself whether the church and its members could live up to her expectations. So, when she and Marina both had a Saturday off work, Marina took her to church. When they entered the church, Sahana saw Michael, the man she had met in the hospital. She was surprised to learn that he was the leader of this small congregation.

After church, Sahana confided to her friend, “The people are so friendly and gracious. This church is exactly as you said it would be. I feel as if I have found my spiritual home at last.”

When Sahana returned home after church that day, she eagerly told her parents about her worship experience. Her parents had never heard of Seventh-day Adventists; so, Sahana explained to them some of the basic beliefs and told them about the books she had read. She opened the Bible and read them the Ten Commandments and explained that God had never abolished His law, nor had He changed it. “Jesus and His disciples kept these same laws,” she told them.

Sahana’s parents were glad she was so happy. They encouraged her to follow her new beliefs, but they would continue to attend the church they had attended for years.

Sahana’s year of teaching was almost up, and she began looking for another job. At the same time Sahana’s parents began looking for a husband for her.

“I am worried about the man my parents will choose,” Sahana confided to Marina. “You and your husband came to your faith together, but what if my parents choose a man for me who doesn’t want me to worship as an Adventist? It will be difficult for me to keep my faith if I marry someone who doesn’t share my beliefs.”
