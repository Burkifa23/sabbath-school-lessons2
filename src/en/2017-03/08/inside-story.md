#### Innocently Jailed: Part 1

Could life get any worse? Prabha wondered as she sat in the jail cell. I’m innocent of this crime. Why don’t the gods listen to me? Prabha was barely 16 years old when she was arrested for a murder she didn’t commit.

Prabha’s family was poor. She and her sisters hadn’t attended school and had to work to help feed their family. When she was 15, her father died, plunging the family deeper into poverty. Father had become a Christian before his death, but what good did it do him? Prabha wondered. He died anyway.

Prabha worked for a wealthy elderly woman whom she respectfully called “Ma”—cooking, cleaning, and sometimes keeping her company. Ma was good to Prabha, who often was her only companion since her own husband had died.

One evening as Prabha was preparing to go home, Ma begged her to stay with her that night so she wouldn’t be alone. Prabha agreed. She knew that Ma was lonely, for her adopted son was out of town.

About 3:00 a.m. Ma called to Prabha. “Please heat water for my ritual bath. I want to be ready for morning prayers, for today is the festival for my god.” Prabha nodded and walked through the dark house to the kitchen.

Opening the kitchen door, she discovered several men hiding there. Before she could scream, they grabbed her and covered her mouth. One man pulled a knife and waved it threateningly at her, cutting her several times. Another tied her with rope and shoved her into the corner. Trembling, she watched the men make their way toward Ma’s room.

Prabha heard Ma shout as the men entered her room. She heard the men demand Ma’s money, jewels, and gold. Then she heard a muffled scream and a thud. Scuffles followed, then the men ran out of the house.

Prabha struggled free of the ropes, but discovered the kitchen door locked. She broke a window and crawled through, calling for help. In Ma’s room she found the old woman lying still on the floor. “Ma, Ma!” Prabha called as she gently shook the old woman. But it was too late; Ma was dead.

Prabha shouted out the window to a passing man to call the police. “Robbers broke in and have killed Ma!” she shouted hysterically.

The police arrived, and Prabha told them what had happened. They took her to the hospital, where her wounds were treated. But when she was released, the police arrested her and took her to jail. They were convinced that Prabha had killed Ma.
