#### David’s Amazing Discovery: Part 1

David Pan stared at the words in his Bengali-language Bible: “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.”As a teacher in a traditional Christian faith, David was amazed he had never noticed those words.

What did it mean? Which day was the seventh day? According to his calendar, the seventh day was Saturday. He didn’t know anyone who worshiped on Saturday. “I must ask the bishop about this,” he told his wife, Swarna. “Surely he’ll have an answer.”

“Forget what the Bible says,”the bishop advised David. “Continue to worship on Sunday as you’ve always done.”

The bishop’s answer puzzled David even more. Why was the bishop unwilling to discuss the Sabbath with me? he wondered.

On arriving home, David shared his perplexity with Swarna. “The Bible says plainly that we should keep the seventh day holy. But the bishop couldn’t give me a satisfying answer to why we worship on Sunday. I don’t know what to do.”

“Perhaps we should fast and pray about it,” Swarna suggested. “If we’ve been worshiping on the wrong day, God will show us.”As David and Swarna fasted and prayed, the conviction remained that they should worship on the seventh-day Sabbath.

The next day a visitor came to their house. “Have you ever heard of a church that worships on Saturday, the seventh day of the week?” David asked him.

“Yes,”the visitor replied. “There’s a church in Calcutta that holds services on Saturday.” The visitor gave the church’s address.

The next Saturday morning, David and Swarna went to Calcutta and found the church. They were delighted to find people there studying the Bible. After the service, the couple visited with a businessman named John and his wife. During their conversation, David and Swarna told them of their search for truth. “We want someone to come to our home to tell us more about why you keep Saturday,” David said.

“We’ll come,” John promised.

Soon afterward, John and another man visited David and Swarna in their home. Before long, David and his family invited John and a friend to hold Sabbath services in their home. A few others from the church in Calcutta came to support the couple in their search for truth.

Satisfied that the Seventh-day Adventist Church was teaching Bible truth, David resigned his job as a teacher in his church and began sharing the Sabbath truth with others. After more than seven months of study, David and Swarna were baptized along with many others with whom they had shared their new faith.
