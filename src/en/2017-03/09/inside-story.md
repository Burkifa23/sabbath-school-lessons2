#### Innocently Jailed: Part 2

Every day the police questioned Prabha. They beat her hands and woke her in the middle of the night for further interrogations. They questioned Prabha’s brothers and mother, trying to find some thread that would incriminate her. How long had she planned this robbery? Where had she hidden the gold and rupees?

Prabha begged her family’s gods to help and promised to shave her head if they would free her, but nothing happened. The questioning continued, and Prabha grew more weary.

One night as she slept on the cement floor, she dreamed that a man in white touched her and told her to not be afraid. “I am with you,” He promised. “Soon you will be free.”

“Who are you?” Prabha asked the man. “I am Jesus,” He answered.

The next day the police questioning continued. But this time when they beat her, instead of crying she prayed, “Jesus, ifYou are the true God, please help me.”Two hours later she was released from prison, but she had to return the next day for further questioning.

Every day Prabha went to the police station. If they had a new clue, they questioned her about it. If they caught a thief, they called her to identify him. This continued for more than a year.

Prabha remembered her dream, and she and her family began attending a Christian church. One day a Seventh-day Adventist lay member visited Prabha’s home. He offered to teach them more about Jesus. When he told them about the Sabbath, Prabha’s brothers challenged him.

“Why do Christians worship on Sunday if the Bible commands them to worship on Sabbath?” The Adventist explained that the Sabbath was established at Creation, affirmed in the Ten Commandments, and honored by Jesus, even after His death.

A few weeks later the Adventist invited Prabha’s family to attend evangelistic meetings. They agreed and invited some friends. Following the meetings Prabha and her family were baptized.

Soon after Prabha’s baptism the thieves who had killed Ma were arrested. The police asked her to identify them. In an ironic twist, the families of the thieves asked Prabha and her family to pray for their imprisoned husbands. The thieves served only one year in prison. Six of the eight accepted Jesus as their Lord, and one is now a lay preacher. The two thieves who refused to become Christians died violent deaths.

Good came from Prabha’s troubles. Her family found Jesus; thieves were converted; and Prabha now serves as a Bible worker.
