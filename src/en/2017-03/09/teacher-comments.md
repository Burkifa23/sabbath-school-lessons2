### The Lesson in Brief

**Key Text**: Galatians 4:12

#### The Student Will:

- **Know**: Describe how Paul’s letter to the Galatians moved from scriptural argument to one based on personal appeal.
- **Feel**: Appreciate the emotional plea that Paul made as a pastor, sharing his anxieties and reminding the Galatians of their shared experiences.
- **Do**: Resolve to benefit not only from our leaders’ spiritual insights but also from their human love and concern, and support them in turn.

#### Learning Outline:

1. Know: Double Appeal
+ Why did Paul make both a theological and a personal appeal?
+ Why would sharing his ministerial anxieties help the Galatians realize the seriousness of their crisis?

2. Feel: Pastoral Anxiety
+ How did relating their shared history help Paul evoke earlier memories of important lessons?
+ Why might Paul’s arguing, pleading, and agonizing awaken a heartfelt revival of relationship, as well as an intellectual assent to truth?
+ How did Paul contrast his passionate concern for the church’s wellbeing with the false teachers’ desires to court favor?

3. Do: Loving, Though Uncomfortable, Truth
+ How can we be open to lessons that chide and upbraid us, as well as those that encourage and uplift us?
+ How can we, like Paul, use relationships as platforms for sharing truth, even when it is uncomfortable?
+ How can we support those who might have gone through spiritual “childbirth” on our behalf?

**Summary**: After strong spiritual argument, Paul made an emotional appeal to the Galatians to remain in the gospel of grace.

#### Learning Cycle

##### STEP 1—Motivate

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The gospel we preach should be the gospel we live. There is nothing quite as irresistible as a Christian thoroughly in love with Jesus Christ and committed to the salvation of lost human beings.

**Just for Teachers**: Discuss the social reality in which much of the world finds itself today, a reality in which words and deeds rarely come together to give a clear picture of who people really are.

Talkers abound. One need only turn on the radio, watch the television, or surf the Internet to discover a retinue of talking heads who are only too happy to opine about the latest hot-button issue. Financial analysts feel qualified to decry the state of the education system. Politicians say one thing when seeking election, then do the opposite once in office, all the while accepting thinly veiled bribes from special interests.

And then there are those who on national airwaves spew up words and antics calculated to breed hatred. The world seems to be awash in a torrent of meaningless blather—people totally out of their depth who nevertheless continue on undaunted.

Like a military commander depositing stealth fighters behind enemy lines, God drops the Christian into the din of empty talk to live and speak the gospel. What amazing love for a fallen world.

**Consider This**: Ask the class to come up with a list of the “big talkers” who dominate the media. What is it that keeps them in the news? Why do they have an audience? Are their core messages positive or negative? Finally, do they live what they spew?


#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: As you explore this week’s commentary, the class will take a close look at Paul’s personal obedience to God, his willingness to sacrifice to see Christ formed in believers, and his emotional efforts to get them to choose Christ. Paul’s heart for the lost is positively inspiring.

**Bible Commentary**

**I. Reaching the Heart Through a Living Faith** (Read 1 Corinthians 9:19–23, Acts 14:1–26, and Galatians 4:12 with your class.)

Tuesday’s study treats us to an exploration of one of the most important aspects of sharing truth: truth that is contextualized for the people with whom it is shared has the best chance of reaching the heart. Paul’s understanding of this reality led him to “become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some” (1 Cor. 9:22, NIV).

In spite of his noble desire to lead others to Jesus, Paul does not approach his task carelessly, especially as it relates to his understanding of God’s law and civic legal codes. There is a reason for Paul’s strict adherence to a personal code of conduct that is above reproach. While Paul and Barnabas were ministering in Iconium—with great success—“the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren” (Acts 14:2, NKJV). The multitude of the city became so divided that “part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles” (Acts 14:4, NKJV).

The apostle Paul could not afford to be reckless in the way he lived his faith. For one, his enemies kept close tabs on him; but more than that, Paul’s desire was to please God first and foremost.

**Consider This**: Ask someone in the class to read Luke 15:1–10. Note the fact that Jesus faced spurious attacks when attempting to do good to those on the margins of society during His day. Ask: In what ways did Paul’s contextualization of the gospel mirror Christ’s? In what ways did it differ?

**II. Whatever It Takes** (Review Galatians 4:19, John 3:3, and Colossians 1:27 with your class.)

Paul used the metaphor of childbirth to make the point that he had endured, as it were, the pangs of childbirth in order to bring these people to Christ. But as they contemplated returning to a legalistic form of the faith, the process of “birthing” them would have to begin again. Paul is no doubt echoing the language of Jesus as He spoke to Nicodemus (see John 3).

The apostle persisted in the Galatian outreach because he wanted Christ to be fully formed in them and reign in their hearts (Gal. 2:20). As Wednesday’s study makes clear, Paul presses through personal illness to complete his task. In his letter to the Colossians, he again uses the language and metaphor of maternity to make clear that Christ’s being formed in us represents humanity’s only “hope of glory” (Col. 1:27).

**Consider This**: Explore the concept of spiritual growth with your class. What does the life of a Christian look like once Christ begins to be formed within? What changes? What stays the same? Why was Paul so motivated to help the Galatian believers come to a deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ as their only Source of salvation? What did Paul’s life look like after Christ was “birthed” in his heart? How might this change in his own life, and the corresponding freedom it brought, have been the driving force behind Paul’s desire to see others experience the same?

**III. Closing the Deal** (Read Galatians 4:16 and 2 Corinthians 1 and 2 with your class.)

Emotional appeals are one of the truly distinguishing characteristics of the apostle Paul. At a time when many ministers of the gospel shy away from making sermonic appeals, Paul’s “naked” appeals seem out of step. To be sure, emotions can be played like an instrument, and many religious leaders have mastered the trade, but Paul is not being insincere.

In Galatians 4:16, Paul, a close friend of the Galatian believers, risked that friendship in an effort to help them “see” Christ through the haze of legalism that had enveloped them. “Are you angry at me because I tell you the truth?” he’d say in today’s parlance.

Paul’s appeal to the Corinthian church in 2 Corinthians 1 and 2 is even more disquieting. His ministerial authority challenged, Paul wrote: “For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you” (2 Cor. 2:4, NKJV).

Paul’s love for those he wanted to come to know Christ underpinned his appeals and made them effective.

**Consider This**: Why are some Christians afraid to put their “hearts” on the line as they reach out to others? Some cultures are more reserved than others. What role should cultural norms play in the way we appeal to men and women on behalf of Christ?

##### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Encourage your students to answer the personal inventory questions below. Allow time for those who may wish to share their responses.

**Thought Questions**:

1. How did you come to accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior? Was it through the encouragement of a friend, a great sermon that convicted your heart, or an appeal that you simply could not resist? What “hooked” you and made you want to give your life to Jesus?
2. Paul often faced rejection in his efforts to win souls to Christ. Does the fear of rejection stop you from sharing your faith? How do you plan to overcome it?

**Application Question**:

1. Second Corinthians 5:20 states: “Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ’s behalf, be reconciled to God” (NKJV). What specific gifts or talents do you possess that God can use to plead for others through you?

**Questions for Witnessing**:

1. It is obvious that a chorus of contradictory voices was confusing the Galatian believers. If not, Paul would not have gone to such great pains to explain the law and the ways in which it complements faith in Jesus Christ. What unique challenges does the “chattering class” of our day present for the Christian attempting to share God’s gospel?
2. How do we strike the correct balance between building relationships with those we wish to see saved and telling them the truth? What role does the Holy Spirit play in the process?

##### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Distribute slips of paper to the class, and ask them to write one or two sentences detailing how we should appeal to the people mentioned in the following scenarios:

1. An often-inebriated man wanders by your church each Sabbath because he knows that he’s sure to get a hot meal, and some members will give him money. He never comes to church for any of the services. How should the church respond?
2. Sarah has visited your church several times. She is attentive during the services and has even purchased a Bible for the first time so that she can follow along with the minister. Everyone wonders when she’ll give her heart to Jesus and become baptized, but your minister rarely makes appeals.When he does, he seems uncomfortable and rushes to end it. How would you go about appealing to Sarah?
3. A close friend of yours has been cheating on her taxes for years. She looks for all the loopholes to save money, but she also goes over the line. She sometimes jokes about it with you and justifies her behavior by saying, “It’s my money anyway. All the government does is waste it.” How would you go about helping her to see that this behavior is wrong? Would you bring God into the mix, or just address her from the legal perspective—that she is breaking the law? Explain.
