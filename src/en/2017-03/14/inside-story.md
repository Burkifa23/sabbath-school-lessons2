#### Match Made in Heaven: Part 3

“You should pray very hard about it,” Marina said. “This is a serious situation.” Then Marina added a surprising comment. “Maybe I can help your parents to find an Adventist man. I know a few people.”

“Would you really?” Sahana asked. “That would be wonderful.”

Sahana spoke with her mother about her concerns. “Mother, I want to marry an Adventist man.”

“All these different churches are really the same,” her mother said. “And I don’t know any Adventist men.”

“My friend Marina can help you to find an Adventist husband for me,” Sahana said.

“Well, yes, if Marina has someone in mind, we will certainly consider him,” her mother replied.

Marina knew that Pastor Michael would be married soon. She knew that many Adventist young people would come to his wedding. Marina learned that Aby, a young man from some distance away was coming and would stay with Marina and her family. She invited Sahana to meet this young man in her home.

Sahana prayed earnestly that God would lead her to a fine Adventist young man, and she felt the Holy Spirit’s assurance that He had heard her prayers.

When the young man arrived, Sahana was pleased that he was so courteous—and handsome. She learned that he was a software engineer. The two talked together in Marina’s home for several hours. Sahana’s parents met Aby and also were impressed by him.

After the pastor’s wedding, Aby returned home, and Sahana did not speak to him again. Two days later Aby’s mother requested a photo of Sahana. Two months later Aby’s parents met Sahana and her parents. The meeting went well. When Aby’s parents returned home, his mother told her son, “She is a dream girl, the girl I would choose for you.”

Wedding arrangements began. When Sahana’s school contract ended, she was baptized—by Aby’s father. Three months later the couple was married. Their wedding day marked the second time they had seen each other, as is the custom in arranged marriages.

Though they were all but strangers at their wedding, Sahana and Aby are convinced that God led them to each other. They have settled into a life together with God as the center of their home and now have two children of their own.
