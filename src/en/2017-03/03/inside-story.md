#### Rescue in the River: Part 2

The atmosphere grew tense. Some of the rowdies threatened the baptismal candidates with sticks. “We don’t want Christians in our village!” one man shouted. “We have our own gods and our own ways of worship. You must not follow these men who have come to teach their religion. You must continue in the way of our ancestors.”

“It doesn’t look like we’ll have a baptism today,” one of the pastors whispered to the other pastors. Perhaps they would have to return on another day.

Just then the pastors heard a young woman’s voice rise above the angry shouts of the crowd. It was Rebecca Tudu, one of the baptismal candidates. “Nobody is going to stop me from being baptized today!” she shouted. “We live in a free country. I will worship whatever God I choose. I choose Jesus Christ, and I am going to be baptized today whether you like it or not!”

With those words, Rebecca marched through the mob and on toward the baptismal site. None of the men moved to stop her. Seeing her fearless spirit, 15 other baptismal candidates followed her.

Those 16 new believers were baptized that day while the angry villagers looked on. The believers, empowered by the Holy Spirit and Rebecca’s brave action, took a bold stand for Jesus Christ.

Benjamin was among those baptized that day. His baptism brought another miracle into his life. Before his baptism, his eyesight was so poor that he could barely see. But after his baptism his eyesight improved, and now he is able to read the Bible without difficulty.

“Twice God has revealed Himself to me,” Benjamin testified. “I have no doubt that God is alive and hears my prayers.” Benjamin spends much of his time giving his testimony to the people in the nearby villages.

A week after her baptism Rebecca went to her home village to tell her parents what she had learned during the past few weeks. She shared the Bible truths she treasured and told them about the excitement on the day of the baptism. Her parents were eager to learn more about God and asked Rebecca to invite the pastors to visit their village and teach them.

The pastors came and studied with Rebecca’s parents for several weeks. One happy day Rebecca stood by a riverbank and watched her parents be baptized. Her two brothers also took their stand, along with others from her village.
