#### Match Made in Heaven: Part 1

From the time she was a young girl, Sahana loved God and attended church every Sunday. Sometimes, however, she wished that the worship service wasn’t so loud and exuberant.

Sahana finished her studies and took a teaching position at a women’s college. She lived with her parents, as is the custom in India. She knew that soon her parents would choose a husband for her.

Sahana enjoyed her work at the college and made many friends there. She especially liked Marina, another teacher at the school.

One day Marina fell ill with malaria and was admitted to the hospital. Sahana went to the hospital to visit her friend. While waiting outside Marina’s room, she met a man who was also waiting. They started talking.

Sahana learned that the man’s name was Michael and that he was a writer of religious books. “What church do you belong to?” Sahana asked.

“I’m a Seventh-day Adventist,” Michael said.

Sahana wanted to know more about this man’s religion, but in her culture it isn’t appropriate for a single girl to talk to a man for more than a few minutes. So her questions would have to wait. Soon she was able to visit Marina.

However, Sahana couldn’t stop thinking about this young man and wondering about his church. Sahana had read the Bible, and she had many questions that her pastor couldn’t answer. Perhaps Michael’s church would have the answers. Sahana decided that when Marina felt better, she would ask her more about Michael and his faith.

When Sahana saw Marina on campus again, she cornered her friend.

“I met your friend Michael while waiting to see you in the hospital. He told me that he’s a Seventh-day Adventist. What is a Seventh-day Adventist? Do you know anything about this church?”

“A little,” Marina answered. “I’ve been attending the Adventist church for a year now. They worship on Saturday because the Bible tells us to keep the seventh day holy.”

“Oh,” Sahana said, surprised. “I’ve read about the seventh day in the Bible, and I have a lot of questions. Can you answer them?”

Marina tried to answer Sahana’s questions. Then she said, “The people at the Adventist church are friendly and kind. My husband has joined the church, but since I work on Saturdays, I haven’t joined. I’m not ready to give up my job.”

“Does this church teach about the books of Daniel and Revelation?” Sahana asked with excitement. “I don’t understand them, and I would like to know what they mean.”
