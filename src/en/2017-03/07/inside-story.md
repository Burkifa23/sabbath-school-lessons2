#### No More Devil Stones: Part 2

The meetings began a few days later. While the villagers built a shelter out of poles and thatch near Yerakayya’s home, the pastor conducted meetings outside another villager’s home.

When the pandal was finished, the larger meetings began. About one hundred fifty people from the village came. As the pastor began to speak, stones rained down on the thatch-roofed shelter. They fell through the roof and dropped among the crowd. The people dodged the stones, and one man stood and interrupted the pastor. “The devils are troubling us again. See these stones that have fallen among us!”

Pastor Rao said, “Don’t be afraid. Let’s pray to the living God and let Him handle our problem.” Then he prayed in a loud voice: “Father, You are the living God. This devil is disturbing our meetings, and these people want to know more about You. Show them that You are the real God and make the devil stop throwing stones!” Then Pastor Rao shouted at the demons—“In the name of Jesus, I command that the devils leave this village!” At that instant a stone hit the thatched roof, but it didn’t fall through; it stayed where it landed.

The people stood in awe for a moment, then they sat down to listen to the sermon. Not once after the pastor’s prayer did a stone fall through the roof. And no stones rained on Yerakayya’s home either. From that day on, the family slept peacefully through the night.

Yerakayya was convinced. He would worship the true God, and he gave up his drinking. The couple invited their three grown children and their grandchildren to attend the meetings, and all of them now worship the God of heaven.

Each believer who has given his or her life to Christ has pulled down his or her idols and thrown them into the nearby river.

Yerakayya is so excited about the differences that Jesus has made in his home and his village that he invited the pastor to go with him to a nearby village where some of his relatives and friends live, and there share the story of Redemption. Yerakayya told the villagers how God stopped the devils from throwing rocks on his house, and he urged the people to listen to the pastor tell about the living God. Thus, a second village in the area has been opened to the gospel, and more than one hundred fifty have been baptized.

Work in India continues to grow rapidly, and your generous Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will provide much needed assistance. Thank you for giving.
