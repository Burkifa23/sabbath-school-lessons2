#### Rescue in the River: Part 1

Benjamin Murmu was crippled by polio, but he managed to get around with a cane. He was well-known in the hills of Bihar, India—as a witch doctor and later as a political leader. Then one day, God revealed Himself to Benjamin.

While riding his horse, Benjamin came to a river that he needed to cross. The river was swollen, and the current looked dangerous. Slowly Benjamin urged the horse into the swirling waters. The horse struggled to keep its head above water, but the swift current quickly swept horse and rider downstream.

Thrashing its legs, the horse tried to find a foothold, but the water was too deep. Benjamin couldn’t swim; his only hope for survival was to cling to the horse. His heart beat wildly as he tried to guide his horse toward shore, but the animal was helpless against the current. Fearing certain death, Benjamin cried out to God for the first time in his life. “God! IfYou are there, please help me! Help me!”

Suddenly Benjamin saw two men beside him in the water. Without a word, they grabbed the horse and pulled both horse and rider to solid ground. Benjamin lay on the shore, trying to catch his breath. When he turned to thank the two men who had rescued him, they were gone. His eyes scanned the flat, treeless landscape in search of the men, but they had simply disappeared.

Slowly Benjamin realized that God had answered his prayer and sent angels to rescue him. That moment marked the turning point in his life. There on the riverbank, still shaking from his ordeal, Benjamin made up his mind to become a Christian.

Some time later, Seventh-day Adventist evangelists held meetings in Benjamin’s village. Benjamin attended and accepted the truth that he learned there. He asked to be baptized at the end of the meetings.

But not everyone was happy to have the evangelists preach in their village. Several times people tried to disrupt the meetings, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful, and a number of new believers asked to be baptized.

On the day of the baptism, the pastors encountered a crowd of drunken men along the road that led from the meeting place to the baptismal site. The men allowed the pastors to pass by, but then they blocked the road and didn’t allow the believers to pass.

Meanwhile the pastors waited for the new believers to arrive. But as time passed and no one came, the pastors grew concerned. They sang and prayed for some time, but still the new believers didn’t come.
