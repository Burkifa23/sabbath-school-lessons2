### Read for this week’s lesson
Psalm 37:21; Matthew 4:3–10; Matthew 6:33; Deuteronomy 28:12. 

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “Give to everyone what you owe them. Do you owe taxes? Then pay them. Do you owe anything else to the government? Then pay it. Do you owe respect? Then give it. Do you owe honor? Then show it. Pay everything you owe. But you can never pay back all the love you owe one another. Whoever loves other people has done everything the law requires [commands]” (Romans 13:7, 8, NIrV). 

You may know someone kind enough to loan you money when you need it. But most people do not give you money because they want to help you. Instead, they give you money because they want to make more money from you while you pay back the money you owe them. 

We should do our best to avoid owing money. Of course, sometimes we need to borrow money. We might need to borrow money when we buy a house or a car, build a church, or go to school. But we must borrow money very carefully. We must borrow money with the desire to pay it back as soon as we can. 

So, we must be careful. We must not spend money that we do not have. That is a trap for God’s people. 

We must make ourselves better and improve our skills. Then we can stay in control of ourselves and do our best to avoid owing anyone money. This week we will look at what the Bible says about owing money.
