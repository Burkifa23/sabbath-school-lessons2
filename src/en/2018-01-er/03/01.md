### Read for this week’s lesson
Psalm 33:6–9; Matthew 19:16–22; 1 Peter 1:18; Hebrews 2:14, 15. 

> <p>Memory verse</p>
> “Because of this, God lifted Jesus high above everything else. He gave Him a name that is greater than any other name. So when the name of Jesus is spoken, everyone in heaven and on earth and under the earth will bow down before Him. And every tongue will say Jesus Christ is Lord. Everyone will give honor to God the Father” (Philippians 2:9–11, NLV). 

HOW DOES GOD FEEL about our wanting too much money? God makes His feelings very clear. Jesus’ words in Luke 12:16–21 to the rich man should cause us all to be afraid of wanting too much. 

We cannot serve God and money. We must choose one or the other. We cannot serve both. People who try to serve both God and money end up getting into trouble. We might fool other people. We even might trick ourselves into believing we are not trying to live for both God and money. But we cannot fool God. One day we must stand before Him and answer for the choices we have made in this life. 

We must choose: God or money. But what happens if we do not choose God? Then the hold that money has on our souls will grow stronger. Faith involves a choice. 

Three things make our choice easier. They are (1) knowing God, (2) knowing the things He has done for us, and (3) knowing how much we owe Him.
