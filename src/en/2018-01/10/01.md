Because of the depth and breadth of stewardship, it is easy to get lost in the big picture, bogged down by tangents and overwhelmed by its enormity. Stewardship is simple yet also complex, and thus can be easily misunderstood. However, neither the Christian nor the church can exist or function without it. To be a Christian is to be a good steward as well.

“It is not a theory nor a philosophy but a working program. It is in verity the Christian law of living. . . . It is necessary to an adequate understanding of life, and essential to a true, vital religious experience. It is not simply a matter of mental assent, but is an act of the will and a definite, decisive transaction touching the whole perimeter of life.” - LeRoy E. Froom, Stewardship in Its Larger Aspects (Mountain View: Calif., Pacific Press Publishing Association, 1929), p. 5.

What are some of the core tenets of what it means to be a Christian steward? This week we will look more at the roles that stewardship plays in Christian life. We will do so, though, through an interesting analogy: a chariot wheel.
