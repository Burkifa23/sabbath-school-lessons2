**Mentally Tortured for Sabbath**

*By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission*

Her mother drenched her with water before Sabbath School.

Her father followed her as she walked - and then ran - to church.

Every time she heard the chain rattle on her father’s locked gun box, she feared he was coming for her.

“I was very, very scared”, said Margaret Wilfred, recounting the years after she was baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. “I was a nervous wreck. To this day it still affects me.

But Wilfred, 61, a retired Adventist grade school teacher in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, has no regrets. ”I am enjoying my walk with God”, she said. “I am getting all the peace I can have now.”

Wilfred was raised by Sunday-keeping parents near the campus of the Adventist-owned University of the South Caribbean in Maracas Valley. From childhood she loved the music that wafted from the campus church on Sabbath. Student singing bands sometimes visited the valley on Sabbath mornings. It was music that attracted Wilfred to an Adventist evangelistic series when she was 19, and she was baptized after the meetings.

“That is when the mental torture started”, she said.

Her parents were furious. Her father threatened her and locked her out of the house. The rattle of the chain on the gun box terrified her. She feared being beaten or worse. Once her father followed her halfway to church.

“I ran all the way because I was scared of what he might do”, she said.

Her mother threw water over her after she had dressed for church.

“Life wasn’t happy for me at all”, she said.

But Wilfred never considered abandoning her faith. She clung to Psalms 34:7, which says, “The angel of the Lord encamps all around those who fear Him, and delivers them” (NKJV). Another favorite is Psalms 27:10: “When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take care of me.”

Eventually, tensions eased at home. Wilfred received a state scholarship to further her education, and she enrolled at the Adventist university. Later she accepted a job at its Maracas Seventh-day Adventist Primary School, where she taught first and second grade for 35 years.

“I know that I am the apple of God’s eye”, she said. “He will see me through anything.”

*A portion of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering in first quarter 2018 will go toward a new church for the University of the South Caribbean, which has never owned a church building and worships in an auditorium.*
