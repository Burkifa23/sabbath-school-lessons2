### Read for This Week’s Study
Heb. 11:8-12; Rom. 4:13, 18-21; Matt. 6:24; Heb. 9:14; 1 John 5:2, 3; Luke 16:10-12.

> “Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful” (1 Corinthians 4:1, 2, NKJV).

Stewards are known by their brand, or their distinctive mark, just as retailers are known by their logos or brand name. In fact, many people have become famous by turning themselves into a marketable brand.

A Christian steward’s brand, or mark, is a reflection of Christ’s love through the relationship that he or she has with Him. When we live and practice the traits of Christ, our lives will reveal our brand. Our brand is His brand; our identity is blended with His (1 Cor. 6:17).

This week we look at identifying character traits of God’s stewards that make up their brand name. These traits inspire us to look for Jesus’ return and to do the work entrusted to us as faithful stewards of His truth. Each characteristic describes a deepening relationship we can have with the One who came to seek and save the lost. The more these qualities are studied, the deeper they will be ingrained in our lives. God’s character of love, in all its dynamics, will become our brand and have an influence on every aspect of our lives, today and eternally.
