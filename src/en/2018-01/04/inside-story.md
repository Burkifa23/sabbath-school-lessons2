**Angel Carries Concrete Blocks**

*By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission*

Vladimir Moskolenko nudged his wife, Galina, awake in the sleepy Ukrainian town of Buzke. He had an unusual dream to share.

“I was standing with concrete blocks in my hands,” he said. “They were so heavy. Then suddenly an enormous, beautiful, shining angel stood before me. He smiled at me. And he put his hands on mine, carrying the concrete, and raised them up.”

Galina Moskolenko sat up. She had been praying for U.S. 5,000 to pay for concrete blocks being used to transform an abandoned building into a Seventh-day Adventist church in their town of 1,400 people.

“Listen, some kind of financial help is on its way,” Moskolenko said. “I don’t know where it will come from, but it will come.”

Two days later, a church member called and said, “Three friends are visiting me from Poland.”

“Here comes our money,” Moskolenko told her husband.

On Sabbath, the Polish visitors listened to Moskolenko’s sermon. After sundown, she told them about the debt.

A bank transfer of 5,000 arrived several days later.

The gleaming Buzke church, which opened in 2016 after 11 years of construction, was built on prayer and miracles, Moskolenko said. An Adventist couple from Australia provided 2,000 fora new roof. The Euro-Asia Division and the local conference provided mission funds. U.S. and Czech church members also contributed.

God and His angels intervened repeatedly, said Moskolenko, 54. She told of a bureaucratic showdown after local authorities rejected a request to knock a hole in a wall to create a second window. “I prayed about it and thought: ‘God, please help us knock a hole in the wall,’” she said.

Then something interesting happened.

“We started to repair the one existing window, and a crack formed in the wall,” she said. “The whole wall was going to collapse.

“Our construction workers quickly brought in a tractor with something to support the wall. But as they worked to prop up the wall, it collapsed as if an angel had said, ‘There you go!’“ Moskolenko said, flicking a finger in the air.

That, she said, is what happens when you do your best and trust in God: He accomplishes the impossible.
