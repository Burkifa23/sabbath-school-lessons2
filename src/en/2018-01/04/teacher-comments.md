#### Learning Cycle 

##### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Proverbs 11:4, 28 

Key Concept for Spiritual Growth: Spiritual life flourishes only as believers intentionally cultivate those practices that create spiritual intimacy with their Creator-Redeemer. 

**Just for Teachers**: Gardeners and farmers know the importance of maintaining constant contact with the soil. Pull a plant out of the ground, and it will die. The roots, the foundation of the plant, cannot sustain life or produce seed without the nutrients they receive by staying in contact with the ground. The physical closeness of the roots with the ground is crucial in order for the plant to live. Sunlight and moisture likewise have roles to play, but unless the roots are secured in their nutrient-rich soil, other positive factors are of little value. 

This principle also applies to the spiritual life. Unless the Christian stays close to Jesus, the spiritual intimacy so vital to Christian growth cannot take root. Thus, scriptural study, prayer, Christian fellowship, and Christian service cannot be considered optional elements of the Christian experience. Rather, they must be considered essential components of a growing spiritual life. 

**Opening Activity**: A week before this study, uproot a plant (a variety of weed is fine) and let it die and dry up in the sunshine. Bring the dead plant and a small potted plant to class. If your class meets outdoors around growing plants, you need not bring the living, potted plant, but may refer to the living plants around you for the purpose of the illustration. Ask the class what properties the dead plant shares with living plants. Answers might include the shape, the size, and possibly the color of the plant. Inquire of the class what the essential difference is between the two plants. Then ask the class why they think that the dead plant died. After telling them that uprooting the plant caused it to die, draw comparisons to our spiritual lives. If we are not constantly receiving God’s grace through the means He has supplied, what will inevitably happen to our spiritual lives? 

##### STEP 2—Explore 

**Just for Teachers**: One of the most remarkable assertions of Scripture is recorded in Romans 8:4–6: “So that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace” (NRSV, emphasis supplied). Paul—who, in the earlier chapters of Romans, built the case regarding the ways in which Jesus satisfies the just requirements of the law—now boldly asserts that these requirements may now be fulfilled in us. The difference between the pre-Christian life and the new life is the direction or focus of our thinking; and the outcomes are as different as life and death. What practices help us focus on things above? 

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. Heavenly Vocabulary** (Review Psalm 119:11, John 5:39, 20:31, Luke 24:27, and 1 Thessalonians 2:13 with the class.) 

“Sing them over again to me,/ Wonderful words of life; / Let me more of their beauty see, / Wonderful words of life. / Words of life and beauty, / Teach me faith and duty; / Beautiful words, wonderful words, wonderful words of life.”—The Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal (1985), no. 286. So opens the classic hymn penned by P. P. Bliss in 1874, issuing an invitation to spiritual life built upon Scripture. Songwriters, theologians, tradespeople, and virtually anyone who reads champions the value of Scripture in transforming the life. How often have we heard of people “reading themselves into the truth”? 

The value of Scripture in spiritual development is beyond calculation. Scripture creates a barrier against sin (Ps. 119:11). Although this protective barrier may be hidden to the casual viewer, it is real. It is not necessary to wear Scripture on our garments as did the Pharisees of old (a modern counterpart arguably might be Bible verse T-shirts), but hiding Scripture in our heart through daily study and prayer should be considered a top priority. Would that Paul’s commendation for the Thessalonian believers could be said of all Christians today: “In spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the Holy Spirit, so that you became an example to all the believers” (1 Thess. 1:6, 7, NRSV). 

**Consider This**: How does Scripture safeguard against sin? 

**II. Celestial Communication** (Review Ephesians 6:18, Mark 11:24, and Luke 11:1–13 with the class.) 

English cleric Samuel Chadwick is quoted as saying, “The one concern of the devil is to keep Christians from praying. He fears nothing from prayerless studies, prayerless work, and prayerless religion. He laughs at our toil, mocks at our wisdom, but trembles when we pray.” Seldom has the importance of prayer been stated more eloquently. Jesus, history’s only perfect human being, went early into the Judean hills for solitude and prayer. If the perfect Son of God needed constant communion with God to make it through His day, how is it that we imperfect, sinful mortals find prayer so unimportant? If prayer is, indeed, the opening of our heart as to a Friend, why would we neglect so great a privilege—especially considering who this Friend is? 

Jesus’ brother James declares, “The prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise them up; and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven. Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective” (James 5:15, 16, NRSV). Oh, that we might crave prayer as earnestly as our lungs crave air! 

**Consider This**: How would armies fare in battle without good communication? How well might we expect to do in our battle with Satan without good communication with our Commander? 

**III. Wisdom From Above** (Review 1 Kings 3:9–14; Proverbs 8:11; 24:13, 14; and 1 Corinthians 3:19 in class.) 

Wisdom is more than information or mere knowledge. It incorporates the ability to make reasonable decisions and judgments based on knowledge and experience. It implies a wealth of knowledge gathered over time that has been applied and tested in different situations and in different time periods. It often suggests a social context, as when Solomon asked God for the wisdom to lead the nation of Israel effectively. Who could be in a better position to obtain wisdom than the Christian who has direct access to the Ancient of Days, who, from eternity, has infinite knowledge and experience? 

**Consider This**: How may the Holy Spirit lead us in applying divine wisdom? 

##### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s study is crucial to our development as believers, but if nothing more than an interesting discussion takes place, we will have failed miserably. If we are to be successful in our spiritual growth, class members must find practical ways to incorporate the practices of prayer and Bible study into their lives. 

**Application Questions**: 

1. How can I become more consistent in Bible study? 
2. How can I spend more time praying without becoming bored or needlessly repetitive? 
3. What are practical steps that I can take to help me cultivate wisdom? 
4. How can interaction with like-minded believers improve my Bible study habits and prayer life?
5. How might studying church history help me develop greater wisdom? 
6. What influence might an extended period of time with God have on my spiritual growth? 
7. How might employing scriptural principles through service enhance my spiritual renewal? 

##### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: Encourage actions that will embed in the daily lifestyles of class members the practices of prayer and Bible study. 

**Activities**: 

1. Have friends take pictures of you praying, studying the Bible, or living your faith in Christian service. Take the best and post them on your refrigerator or your nightstand—any place you will see them often in order to encourage yourself to continue. 
2. Create a worship corner in your home, work, or other personal space for personal Bible study and prayer. Dedicate the corner only for that purpose. 
3. During your Bible study time, begin creating a list of ideas for Christian service. Root this list in scriptural exploration rather than just “needs” that you see in your community. 
4. Start a prayer journal that includes space for summaries of your conversations with God and the date on which each is entered. If you make requests, allow space for later notations in which you recognize that God has answered prayer.
