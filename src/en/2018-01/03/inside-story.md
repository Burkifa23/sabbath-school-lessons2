#### No More Saturday Cartoons

_by Andrew Mcchesney, Adventist Mission_

Adults may speak about the difficulties of adjusting their lives for the biblical Sabbath after being baptized. But what about an 11-year-old boy? Baptism brought an end to Saturday-morning cartoons for Ronnel Nurse, who lives in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago. It also meant telling his beloved grandmother that he could no longer run errands to the grocery store or do other chores.

Nurse, now a 25-year-old IT consultant for Trinidad and Tobago’s

Ministry of National Security, requested baptism during a week of prayer program at Maracas Seventh-day Adventist Primary School on the campus of the University of the Southern Caribbean. His single mother, a nominal Adventist, had enrolled him in the school. But his knowledge about God had come from his grandmother, a devoted Christian who took him to her church every Sunday.

“In those week-of-prayer sessions, I found a thirst, or an emptiness, that I never really knew existed until then,” Nurse said. “When the speaker made the call for baptism, I had a visceral nudge that told me I should step forward. So I did.”

Shortly after his baptism, his grandmother fell ill. She spent most nights in the hospital. Nurse visited her, encouraged her, and let her know that he was praying for her healing. On Sabbaths, he read Bible stories that illustrated God’s miraculous work for His people. He believed Jesus would take care of his grandmother.

“So it came as a complete shock one day when I came home from school and my aunt called to tell me that granny had passed away,” he said. Nurse was 12, and he felt that God had let him down. But as he reflected on his grandmother’s godly life, he realized that the gospel did not culminate with Jesus’ death but with His resurrection and that all who sleep in Jesus also will be raised one day. He made Romans 8:18 his own. The verse reads, “For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us” (NKJV).

Nurse, pictured left, who went on to graduate with a degree in computer science from the University of the Southern Caribbean, said he still misses his grandmother.

“But my faith is strong after being in this university and in this church,” he said.
