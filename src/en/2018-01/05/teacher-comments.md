#### Learning Cycle 

#### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: 1 Thessalonians 2:4 

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Faithful stewards are single-minded in having the best interests of their Overseer, God, at heart. 

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s study focuses on the biblical meaning of stewardship by surveying examples from both the Old and New Testaments. The principles of Scripture form the foundation for stewardship. Modern stewards seek to exemplify those values in contemporary contexts and pass their enthusiasm for their Master to future generations. 

**Opening Discussion**: The word steward is not common in contemporary vocabulary. The social context that gave rise to stewards is uncommon in the modern world, dominated by socialistic, communistic, and democratic-entrepreneurial economies. Read from the following list of words and ask class members which of these modern concepts do they think most closely approximates the ancient role of steward. Have them explain, or give a reason, for their answer. 

**List of Words That Potentially Define the Ancient Role of a Steward**

|plant operator|supervisor|
|foreman|chief of operations|
|guardian|vice president|
|wage earner|farmhand|
|staff member|professional|
|accountant|chief financial officer|

Add other leadership terms that fit better into your economic context and delete from the above list those that do not fit. Write down the best ideas that arise from the class discussion. Compare them with the biblical data surveyed during the lesson study. If possible, write your ideas in a place where all class members can see it. 

##### STEP 2—Explore 

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s study concentrates on developing a biblical understanding of the word steward. Obviously, this definition is foundational for acquiring an accurate perception of the derivative word stewardship. In defining stewardship, our study draws from both the Old and New Testaments, detailing the steward’s activities and responsibilities. 

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. A Steward’s Life** (Review Genesis 2:15; 24:34–38; 39:4; 43:19; Isaiah 22:14– 18; Luke 12:35–48; 1 Corinthians 4:1, 2; Titus 1:7; and 1 Peter 4:10 with the class.) 

Professor N. Avigad identified a tomb on the slopes of the Mount of Olives as being the tomb mentioned in Isaiah’s narrative about Shebna (Isa. 22:14–18). The tomb’s inscription, which was taken to the British Museum, is translated as, “This is [the sepulcher of Sheban]yahu, who is over the house.” (For the complete discussion, see The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 191.) 

The descriptive phrase “who is over the house” typifies the Old Testament portrayal of the steward. Various translations employ different words to describe Shebna, each implying something different about his responsibilities. Several later translations utilize “steward” (ESV, TLV, RSV, NRSV, NASB, HCSB, NKJV, NIV), while other newer works are more creative—“official” (CEB), “caretaker” (VOICE), “palace administrator” (NLT), “manager” (NCV), “servant” (NCV), and even “prime minister” (CEV). Older translations use “treasurer” instead (KJV, ASV, AMPC, MEV). Many employ the phrases “in charge” (GW, NASB) or “taking care of ” (NLV). 

It appears that stewards were considered household members living with their owners. They were indeed servants, but not in the menial sense as, say, a slave. They managed property, probably had lesser servants working under their leadership, managed household schedules, may have held some financial responsibility, and were even considered government “officials.” 

In the New Testament era, there are two Greek words that are translated as steward. The more common is oikonomos, which appears ten times, and epitropos, which occurs three. Oikonomos is a blend of two Greek - words—oikos, the common word for house, and nemo, meaning “to manage” or “set in order.” So, a steward was the person responsible for putting the house in order. The second word, epitropos, was used of stewards in the oikonomos sense but could also refer to government officials or to the guardians of children. In Galatians 4:2, epitropos and oikonomos appear in the same verse. The unique contribution of the New Testament seems to be that it applies the term metaphorically to spiritual matters, as well as using it in the literal sense. This metaphorical usage is explored more deeply in the next section. 

**Consider This**: How does the fact that stewards were entrusted with considerable responsibilities but were still considered servants elevate our concept of Christian servanthood or Christian service? 

**II. Administrating Spiritual Truth** (Review 1 Corinthians 4:1, 2; Titus 1:7; 1 Peter 4:10; Colossians 2:2, 3; and 1 Timothy 3:16 with the class.) 

While the New Testament uses the word steward in the literal sense, like the Old Testament, it expands its use and applies it in the sense of administering spiritual truths or, as Paul says, the mysteries of God. Our Corinthian passage applies the word to ministers of the gospel. Paul’s letter to Titus applies it to church leadership, specifically to elders and overseers. Peter applies it to all believers. Contemplate the risk that God is taking: we hold the eternal treasures of His spiritual riches in finite jars of clay—which is to say, our perishable flesh. 

Consider the responsibility that such a spiritual endowment entails. While Paul’s words of exhortation to be faithful stewards of God’s gospel are important, it is his life that speaks volumes. Despite unimaginable hardships, he purposed to administer the gospel faithfully in ever-widening circles. He recounts his own experience: 

“I have worked harder, been put in prison more often, been whipped times without number, and faced death again and again. Five different times the Jewish leaders gave me thirty-nine lashes. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. Once I spent a whole night and a day adrift at sea. I have traveled on many long journeys. I have faced danger from rivers and from robbers. I have faced danger from my own people, the Jews, as well as from the Gentiles. I have faced danger in the cities, in the deserts, and on the seas. And I have faced danger from men who claim to be believers but are not. I have worked hard and long, enduring many sleepless nights. I have been hungry and thirsty and have often gone without food. I have shivered in the cold, without enough clothing to keep me warm. Then, besides all this, I have the daily burden of my concerns for all the churches. Who is weak without my feeling that weakness? Who is led astray, and I do not burn with anger?” (2 Cor. 11:23–29, NLT). 

Paul embraced his responsibility for administering the gospel and left no stone unturned to ensure that the mission was accomplished. 

**Consider This**: Considering Paul’s legacy of spiritual stewardship and the legacy of many others throughout history, what legacy will I leave behind when I die? 

##### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: God has placed us in an incomparable position of trust. The destinies of lost souls hang in the balance. Every choice we make either furthers God’s mission or slows it down. Who is sufficient for these things! Christ might have entrusted His treasure to angels. He might have called upon the sinless beings of other worlds. He might have destroyed the human race and started all over again. Instead, He sacrificed His life, and He is depending on us to be faithful stewards of His grace in a fallen world. 

**Thought/Application Questions**: 

- How can modern Christians experience the fervor that Paul and Christ’s disciples had for administering spiritual truth to our world? 
- What are the identifying characteristics of faithful stewards in contemporary society? 
- What practical steps must we take to guarantee that Christ’s interests are paramount and ours are only secondary? 
- What promises of the Holy Spirit should encourage us regarding our Christian stewardship? 
- Paul says that we are not our own because we are bought at a price. How might meditating upon that fact motivate our Christian stewardship? 
- How can we extend our influence as faithful stewards so that others will emulate our example? 

##### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: We are certainly stewards of God’s gifts, but, more important, we are stewards of His grace. The two are complementary. The physical and spiritual resources with which God has entrusted us can be effectively used in God’s mission by those who wish to be faithful stewards of the gospel. 

**Activities**: 

- Prepare an outline about today’s topic that you could share with a youth group. Include stories about your personal faith journey, being honest about times you may have put your interest above those of your Overseer. Include stories about how God has blessed you in material and spiritual ways when you placed God’s interests first. 
- Analyze the needs in your community and select one area where you could make a difference, given the unique gifts and talents with which God has entrusted you.
