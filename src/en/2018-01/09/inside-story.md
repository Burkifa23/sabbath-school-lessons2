**Tragedy, Cocaine, and Jesus**

*By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission*

Mervan Jaikaran, a machinery operator at a wood factory on the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, was unconscious for four days and hospitalized for three months after a devastating car accident at the age of 7.

Jaikaran had been walking along the side of the road when the car struck him and dragged him for 50 yards (45 meters), ripping off the side of his face and inflicting deep back injuries.

“Mommy says I was dead and brought back to life”, said Jaikaran, now 52, whose left side of the face is badly scarred. “I say, ‘Mommy, I was dead in sin, but Jesus brought me back to life.”

Jaikaran, one of nine siblings, was raised by a single Seventh-day Adventist mother after his father deserted the family. At the age of 11, he quit school, unable to study because of brain damage sustained in the accident. He started smoking and drinking at 14, and eventually expanded to marijuana and cocaine. He married at 28 and became the father of four.

But Jaikaran kept using drugs, and his wife finally left with the children.

Jaikaran said he desperately wanted to change. One day, he cried out: “Jesus, I want to change. But I don’t want my wife’s help. I don’t want my Mommy’s help. I want Your help.”

Hours later, he received a call from the director of an Adventist-operated drug rehabilitation center called Love Until Ready Center. He subsequently learned that his sister had contacted an Adventist pastor for help, and the pastor had called the rehab center.

Jaikaran eagerly checked himself in for treatment. He was 46.

Progress was slow, but he claimed biblical promises daily. His three favorites were: “You will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You” (Isaiah 26:3); “I will not leave you are forsake you” (Joshua 1:5); and “But seek first the kingdom of God and all His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you” (Matthew 6:33).

He also prayed for the Lord to bind together his family and bind the family closer to the Lord.

At the end of the rehab program, Jaikaran’s estranged wife came to pick him up and drive him to his mother’s house. But when his wife saw he was a new man, she unexpectedly took him home. Both ended up getting baptized.

These days Jaikaran tells everyone he meets about his love for Jesus. He prays daily, “Lord, give me some more so I can talk about you.”

“I believe that the Lord brought me into this world so I can be a witness for Him”, he said. “Nothing is about me. It is all about Him.”
