**Key Text**: 2 Corinthians 9:6, 7 

**The Student Will**: 

- **Know**: Comprehend the close relationship between a heart overflowing with gratitude and the practice of giving.
- **Feel**: Appreciate the depth of God’s merciful graciousness and become excited about opportunities to respond.
- **Do**: Find ways to give. 

**Learning Outline**: 

1. Know: Giving From the Heart 
	+ How does our use of finances indicate what is really important to us? B What are some conditions that stimulate us to give our very best? C How does God measure our giving? D How is giving related to increasing our faith? 

2. Feel: The Heart Experience 
	+ What separates the cheerful giver of whom Paul speaks from the casual or even grudging giver? 
	+ How can we nourish our cheerful-giving side, while “starving out” our grudging-giver tendencies? 
	+ How can we cultivate the gratitude that gives rise to the cheerful-giver experience? 

3. Do: Giving Cheerfully 
	+ How does cheerful giving encourage us to give even more cheerfully? 
	+ Why is it impossible to give cheerfully if our hearts are not filled with gratitude? C What are some practical steps toward, as Paul says, sowing bountifully? 

**Summary**: God delights in the cheerful giver. Such a giver’s cheerful attitude demonstrates that he or she continually experiences gratitude for the abundant blessings with which God has blessed His children.. 

#### Learning Cycle 

##### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: 2 Corinthians 9:6, 7 

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Because God initiated the process of giving, it is, by nature, the most joyful endeavor that human beings can share with their Creator-Redeemer Friend. 

**Just for Teachers**: While it is abundantly clear that God loves cheerful givers, it is equally apparent that cheerful givers love (delight in) God. That loving relationship activates their cheerful generosity. Non-givers and grudging givers somehow have missed that loving relationship; therefore, for them giving has become financially laborious rather than spiritually adventurous. We cannot overestimate the importance of this “love factor,” because the gratitude that love engenders forms the boundary between grudging attitudes and exuberant munificence. 

**Opening Activity**: Consider the following vocabulary list supplied for this activity. Ask class members to assign each description in the list to the cheerful giver, on the one hand, or to the grudging giver or non-giver, on the other. Invite members to explain their reasoning for assigning the term to either side. Focus on how specific attitudes or outlooks lead to or produce a particular giving pattern. Ask class members which attitudes or outlooks they wish to adopt for themselves.

##### STEP 2—Explore  

**Just for Teachers**: Help your students to understand that Scripture distinguishes between tithes and offerings. Both are expected, but there are significant differences between the two. 

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. Tithes and Offerings** (Review Luke 2:21–24; Leviticus 12:1–8; 2 Kings 12:4, 5 with the class.) 

Tithe, by definition, was a specified amount—10 percent. Offerings were unspecified amounts or graduated amounts. It was understood that wealthier Israelites brought greater (more expensive) offerings. Christ’s birth narrative provides a noteworthy example. Luke 2:21–24 chronicles Mary’s postpartum ritual purification, which took place following Christ’s birth. The standard purification offering (Lev. 12:1–8) included a lamb, but exceptions (not exemptions) were established for impoverished persons who could not afford that expense. Mary’s lesser turtledove offering strongly suggests her poverty. 

Tithe was ungraduated and uniformly applied to everyone. Offerings, however, were measured against the giver’s discretionary income— wealthier worshipers bringing more, poorer believers offering less. The use of offerings and tithe also might have differed. Tithe was used to support the priests and Levites, the pastoral staff of Israel’s ancient economy. 

Offerings might also have supplied the needs of the priests, but special collections, separate from tithes, were taken for restoring the temple (2 Kings 12:4, 5). While the sacrificial offerings associated with atonement were appropriated for the priesthood, voluntary thanksgiving offerings could be consumed by the worshiper’s family, together with invited foreigners, orphans, and widows; that is, poorer classes (Deut. 16:11–14). 

Additionally, in the New Testament, Corinthian believers were commended for their collections for impoverished Christians. 

**Discuss**: Describe the difference between tithes and offerings as defined by the Bible. Why are we expected to bring both to God? 

**II. The Alabaster Box** (Review Luke 7:37–47, 8:2, Exodus 34:26, Leviticus 22:19–24, and Numbers 18:29 with the class.) 

God’s absolute unselfishness awakens human generosity. And nowhere do we find that awakening of generosity in the human heart illustrated more beautifully in Scripture than Mary’s act during the feast at Simon’s house. 

“At the table the Saviour sat with Simon, whom He had cured of a loathsome disease, on one side, and Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead, on the other. Martha served at the table, but Mary was earnestly listening to every word from the lips of Jesus. In His mercy, Jesus had pardoned her sins, He had called forth her beloved brother from the grave, and Mary’s heart was filled with gratitude. She had heard Jesus speak of His approaching death, and in her deep love and sorrow she had longed to show Him honor. At great personal sacrifice she had purchased an alabaster box of ‘ointment of spikenard, very costly,’ with which to anoint His body. But now many were declaring that He was about to be crowned king. Her grief was turned to joy, and she was eager to be first in honoring her Lord. Breaking her box of ointment, she poured its contents upon the head and feet of Jesus; then, as she knelt weeping, moistening them with her tears, she wiped His feet with her long, flowing hair. 

“She had sought to avoid observation, and her movements might have passed unnoticed, but the ointment filled the room with its fragrance, and published her act to all present. . . . 

“Mary heard the words of criticism. Her heart trembled within her. She feared that her sister would reproach her for extravagance. The Master, too, might think her improvident. Without apology or excuse she was about to shrink away, when the voice of her Lord was heard, ‘Let her alone; why trouble ye her?’ He saw that she was embarrassed and distressed. He knew that in this act of service she had expressed her gratitude for the forgiveness of her sins, and He brought relief to her mind. . . . 

“The fragrant gift which Mary had thought to lavish upon the dead body of the Saviour she poured upon His living form. . . . 

“Mary knew not the full significance of her deed of love. She could not answer her accusers. She could not explain why she had chosen that occasion for anointing Jesus. The Holy Spirit had planned for her, and she had obeyed His promptings. Inspiration stoops to give no reason. An unseen presence, it speaks to mind and soul, and moves the heart to action. It is its own justification. 

“Christ told Mary the meaning of her act, and in this He gave her more than He had received. . . . As the alabaster box was broken, and filled the whole house with its fragrance, so Christ was to die, His body was to be broken; but He was to rise from the tomb, and the fragrance of His life was to fill the earth.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 558–563. 

However trivial, comparatively speaking, Mary’s humble act of worship may appear to others in the room, it delights Christ. He revels in our heartfelt devotion and praise. Christ asks our best—nothing more, nothing less, nothing else. 

**Consider This**: What does the statement “Your heart will be where your treasure is” (Matt. 6:21, GW) mean? How does Mary’s act of love show us both the spirit, and the measure, in which we should give? In what way does Mary’s fragrant outpouring of love serve as a symbol of what Christ did on the cross? 

##### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: Read the following true account and then discuss the lessons from the story, aided by the thought/application questions that follow. 

Applied Religion—A True Account: Years ago, a small suburban community was flooded when a protective levee broke, submerging dozens of homes within hours. One young man in the community, Dean, was anxious to help those who had just lost everything. Not long before the flood, Dean had accepted Christ. 

The flood happened to occur right after the American Thanksgiving celebration. Many families had just purchased their children’s Christmas presents. Those presents, along with family keepsakes, now lay submerged by nature’s fury. Dean’s church established a relief center outside a Red Cross shelter, supported by a trailer filled with relief supplies. Dean helped shelter occupants acquire clothing and other necessities from the trailer. As he attended to their needs, one pint-sized schoolgirl, hiding within the folds of her mother’s stained skirt, said, “See, Mommy, I told you Jesus would take care of us.”About a decade later, the disaster coordinator met a member of Dean’s church at a conference and inquired about Dean. Dean, the young new convert, was now first elder of his church. 

**Application Questions**: 

- What does Dean’s giving spirit reveal about his heart?
- How did his generous actions prepare him for spiritual leadership?
- How might the unidentified little girl’s comment have motivated Dean toward further generous actions?
- How does selfless giving prepare us for spiritual growth and greater responsibilities? 

##### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: God is the Example of unselfish giving. Therefore, we should make His loving actions, especially the events surrounding the Crucifixion, our daily meditation and study. By emulating the divine example, our hearts are transformed so that we see with God’s eyes and feel with God’s heart. We become His hands to heal the world around us. Thus, united with God’s suffering and God’s joy, we are, grace upon grace, transformed into His likeness. 

**Activities**: 

- Compile a list of literary resources, both inspired and inspirational, that touch your heart with their portraits of God’s unselfish love. 
- Plan a personal weekend retreat for the purpose of spiritual reflection, centered on God’s gifts..
