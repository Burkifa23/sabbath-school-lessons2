**Seeking 3 Signs**

*By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission*

Starlene Peters felt convicted to sign up for a two-week mission trip to South America as she listened to a veteran U.S. missionary speak at a youth conference in her native country of Trinidad and Tobago.

But the desire confused her. She had just returned to the Seventh-day Adventist Church after seven years of wild partying, and she did not feel qualified to serve as a missionary.

“To me, I was not missionary material”, said Peters, who was 25 at the time. “So I decided to pray.”

She asked God for a sign: that random people at the youth conference would tell her to become a missionary. No one knew her, so she thought no one would approach her.

“But several people that same day came up to me and told me, ‘Have you ever thought about being a missionary?’” she said.

Peters rationalized that people were thinking about mission service after the U.S. missionary’s presentation, so she asked God for a second sign: that her father would tell her to become a missionary. “My father is not a church-going person, and I am his only daughter”, Peters said. “So to me the chances were slim to none. I thought I had gotten God into a corner.”

The next day, her father called her and said, “Maybe you should go where God leads you.” He said was pleased with the recent changes in her life.

Peters prayed angrily that night. She didn’t want to risk her job for the mission trip to Guyana. She asked for a third sign: that God provide the U.S. 450 needed for the trip.

The next day, the last day of the conference, a stranger handed Peters a white envelope and walked off. “When I looked inside, it was a check for 450, the exact amount I needed for the trip”, she said.

Peters ended up staying in Guyana for 1 ½ years, teaching at a mission school. Since then, Peters has been going on short- and long-term mission trips nonstop, pausing only to raise funds for the next trip. In 2014, Adventist Church president Ted N.C. Wilson presented her with an award for her work with the church’s One Year in Mission program.

Peters, now 32, said it is never too late - or too soon - to share Jesus.

“Before my first mission trip, I had just come back to church, so I didn’t feel Christian enough to go on a mission trip”, she said. “Now I do all trips all the time. God provides for all my needs.”
