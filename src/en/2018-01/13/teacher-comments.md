**Key Text**: 1 Peter 3:15 

**The Student Will**: 

- **Know**: Recognize the results and benefits of stewardship.
- **Feel**: Appreciate the privileges of a community of believers who live as faithful stewards.
- **Do**: Build a life based on the principles of stewardship, studied throughout this quarter. 

**Learning Outline:** 

1. Know: Lives Well-Lived 
	+ What is the meaning of the phrase “godliness with contentment is great gain” (1 Tim. 6:6, NKJV)? 
	+ How should believers cope with all the things in this world they cannot control? 
	+ How is the faithfulness of Christian stewards related to their influence among nonbelievers? 

2. Feel: Experiencing God’s Affirmation 
	+ How will the affirming words, “ ‘Well done’ ” (Matt. 25:23, NKJV) make us feel when we hear them? 
	+ What sense of reward will Christians feel when they see souls in God’s kingdom because of their stewardship? 

3. Do: Fighting the Good Fight 
	+ How can we live to become “God-revealers” amid a sin-darkened planet? 
	+ How can we unite our efforts as Christian stewards so that our individual efforts are multiplied? 
	+ In what ways can disciples increase their faith? 

**Summary**: The result of stewardship depends upon God, who always does His part, and imperfect human stewards, who sometimes follow His instructions completely, sometimes imperfectly, sometimes partially, and sometimes not at all. The human element is the variable. To improve the results, we must improve the steward. 

**Learning Cycle** 

##### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: 1 Peter 2:12, 3:15 

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The immediate purpose of stewardship is to carry forward God’s mission of redeeming the world. 

**Just for Teachers**: Reiterate to your students the essential truth that Christ is the center of stewardship. Everything that we have learned emanates from Him and revolves around Him. Whether it be tithes and offerings, management of time, or stewardship of influence, Christ must be at the center. Stewardship is not primarily about regulations, practices, and instructions. Those things have their place, but the central theme is about our relationship with Christ. Do we trust Him enough to obey Him? Do we love Him enough to serve Him? Do we want Him enough to let everything else go? Our heartfelt answers to these questions not only measure our effectiveness; they also determine our destinies. 

**Opening Discussion**: Discuss the various workplaces represented by the members of the class. Ask about the goals of their businesses or organizations. Are they running a nonprofit, anxious to keep kids out of crime; a restaurant whose claim to fame is having the best pasta in town; or a global corporation with multiple goals? 

Next, ask how their organizations measure outcomes and results. Are there formal processes or sets of evaluative tools? Are the expectations of management clear from the top to the bottom of the organizations? 

Now apply these concepts to the kingdom. What is the central purpose or mission of the kingdom? How do we measure our effectiveness in satisfying the purposes of the kingdom and in reaching specific goals? How is this information used to make changes that might improve our effectiveness? 

##### STEP 2—Explore 

**Just for Teachers**: Impress upon the minds of your students the reality that negative influences can hinder our effectiveness in outreach in the same way that a little disturbance can negatively impact a vehicle’s traction—snow, ice, dust, grease, rain, bald tires, underinflated tires, overinflated tires, deteriorating road surfaces, debris, et cetera. Properly inflated, new tires and dry roads in good repair can positively influence traction. Now ask your students: How is our spiritual traction in our communities? Are we viewed as outsiders, seen as religious extremists? Are we invisible? Are we only seen during “Ingathering” season? Do people perceive that we are involved actively in improving our communities? Are we exercising our stewardship in ways that extend our Christian influence? 

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. Godliness** (Review Job 1:1, 29:11–17, 2 Timothy 3:1–9, and James 1:27 with the class.) 

Paul speaks about those who have forms of godliness without any spiritual power. This approach to godliness was practiced by many Pharisees. For them, godliness was about appearances. True religion, however, as defined by James and other writers of Scripture, is neither a facade nor the escape practiced by monastic orders that eschew contact with the outside world. True religion is being a faithful steward of God’s grace and is shown in tangible changes that improve our world, relieve suffering, and lead people to God. James defined it. Job exemplified it. Job was upright in his possession of wealth, and he diligently distributed to those in need. Jeremiah exemplified true godliness and outstanding stewardship by being a faithful spokesperson for God, despite the personal suffering he endured. The eleventh chapter of Hebrews is full of those who answered God’s call to faithfulness. We are called to be the next chapter. 

**Consider This**: How did Job’s life exemplify James’s definition of true religion? How might a similar revelation of godliness through your church members change your community? 

**II. Godliness With Contentment** (Review Philippians 4:4–13, 1 Timothy 6:1–10, and Hebrews 13:5–7.) 

It would be hard to argue against the assertion that godliness alone is great gain. Nevertheless, Scripture couples godliness and contentment together as constituting great gain. What does contentment add? It certainly emphasizes trust, appreciation, and thankfulness. Whenever we claim that God is our provider and complain constantly about His provision, it does not seem very consistent. Paul said that he could be content in any circumstance. That was quite the statement from someone who had endured as many trials and near-death experiences as Paul had. Read 2 Corinthians 11:23–33 for a concise sampling and expand your knowledge by reading the second half of Acts. Paul did not lead an easy life, but he enjoyed a contented life. 

Contentment is not so much about your circumstances as it is about your attitude toward your circumstances. Jesus said that foxes and birds had homes while He had no place to lay His head; yet, Jesus was the perfect example of contentedness (Matt. 8:20). Agur asked God to send him neither poverty nor riches. Riches would tempt him to arrogance. Poverty might lead him to theft (Prov. 30:7–9). What wisdom! Besides, what earthly riches can compare with the treasure we have in Christ? 

**Consider This**: How does contentment demonstrate trust in God? 

**III. The Trusting Soul** (Review Proverbs 3:5, Isaiah 55:9, Matthew 22:37, 1 Corinthians 4:5, and 13:12 with the class.) 

Christ said that hearts follow treasure. How truly we see this illustrated in a negative way in the sad tale of the rich, young ruler (Matthew 19). Riches were the breaking point for this promising and talented young man. “His claim that he had kept the law of God was a deception. He showed that riches were his idol. He could not keep the commandments of God while the world was first in his affections. He loved the gifts of God more than he loved the Giver. . . . 

“Only those who will become co-workers with Christ, only those who will say, Lord, all I have and all I am is Thine, will be acknowledged as sons and daughters of God. All should consider what it means to desire heaven, and yet to turn away because of the conditions laid down. Think of what it means to say ‘No’ to Christ. The ruler said, No, I cannot give You all. Do we say the same? The Saviour offers to share with us the work God has given us to do. He offers to use the means God has given us, to carry forward His work in the world. Only in this way can He save us. 

“The ruler’s possessions were entrusted to him that he might prove himself a faithful steward; he was to dispense these goods for the blessing of those in need. So God now entrusts men with means, with talents and opportunities, that they may be His agents in helping the poor and the suffering. He who uses his entrusted gifts as God designs becomes a co-worker with the Saviour. He wins souls to Christ, because he is representative of His character.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 520–523. 

The rich, young ruler could not trust God with his treasure. He turned away sorrowfully from Jesus’ invitation to follow Him. The final verses of the sixth chapter of Matthew remind us about the rewards of being able to trust God completely as do the birds. What an emotional release! Oh, that we might trust God completely. 

**Consider This**: What might Hebrews 11:6 mean when it says that it is impossible to please God without faith (trust)? 

**IV. How to Influence People** (Review Ephesians 5:8; Matthew 5:16; Titus 2:7; 1 Peter 2:11, 12; and 3:15 with the class.) 

Imagine the influence God has when Christians reflect His character. Being a conscientious and cheerful worker, a compassionate neighbor, a fair-minded employer, and a good sport mean so much more than hackneyed religious spiel. Sharing Christ may simply be babysitting so that a single mother can go on a job interview; mowing the lawn gratis for an elderly couple; or visiting a neighbor’s child in prison. Actually, when we do these things, we are doing them for Christ (Matt. 25:31 onward). This Christ-centered influence has the power to win the world. 

**Consider This**: What are some ways that negative influences might drive people away from God? 

##### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: James admonishes us to be Christians who do the Word, not just Christians who hear it (James 1:22–27). Talk really is cheap. If we are not seeing the results we would like to see from our evangelistic efforts, maybe we should start talking less and start doing more. 

**Thought/Application Questions**: 

- What do you think the criteria for acceptance will be when Jesus chooses those whom He affirms with the words “ ‘Well done’ ” (Matt. 25:21, NIV)? Conversely, what is the standard of conduct for those who hear “ ‘Depart from Me’ ”(Matt. 25:41)? 
- How can we demonstrate that we have learned the importance of knowing how to love? 
- How might inner contentment win friends and serve as a bridge to spiritual conversations with unbelievers? 
- How are contentment, confidence, and trust related to one another? 

##### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: Jesus talked about going extra miles. When our attitude becomes “How little can I get by with?” rather than “How much can I do?” we allow the wedge of selfishness to enter our lives. The safe course is doing as Christ has done: sacrificing all. 

**Activity** 

Write down three things you have gained from this quarter’s Bible study guide and determine, by God’s grace, to implement them in your life. Start a journal, recording how these changes are making a positive difference in your world.
