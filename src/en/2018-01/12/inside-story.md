**Prodigal Daughter**

*By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission*

Starlene Peters, bruised and wearing crumbled clothes after a night of partying followed by a drunken car crash, walked into the Seventh-day Adventist church on Sabbath morning.

A former Adventist, she wasn’t sure how church members, long ignored, would respond to her presence. But a friend had died in the car accident hours earlier, and she needed to find God.

“I saw that accident as a wake-up call”, said Peters, 32, now a full-time missionary. “I realized how fragile life was.”

Peters was raised by an Adventist grandmother in Port of Spain, capital of the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago. From a young age, she was required to attend church every Sabbath. She held various church positions after her baptism, but she said her service was not genuine. “For most of my childhood I didn’t feel any connection with God”, Peters said.

At 18, she left home and the church to embark on a life of partying.

Then the car accident occurred. Peters and two friends were driving home after a Friday night of partying, and the driver, who was intoxicated, wrecked the vehicle. Peters and the driver escaped with scratches, but their friend, a 26-year-old woman, was killed.

Peters was whisked away from the accident scene to the hospital for a checkup. Then police questioned her at the police station. After that, Peters headed straight for church.

Peters had nothing to wear but her partying attire: a short dress, earrings, and makeup. She didn’t know what to expect. She hadn’t worshipped at the church in seven years.

The pastor was preparing to start the sermon when Peters walked in the door. All eyes turned on her. Then the church members abruptly broke into song.

“They stopped the service and started a sing-a-thon because they were so happy that I was in church after so many years”, Peters said.

It was a welcome worthy of the prodigal son in Jesus’ parable from Luke 15:11-32.

At that moment Peters decided to give her life to Jesus and start over.

“I made a deal with God: All or nothing”, she said. “I got rebaptized, and that is where my life began.”
