**Summary**: Negative or positive habits are formed through repetition. Athletes cultivate their skills by practicing certain patterns again and again. That is why nearly every sport calls the periods of preparation for the future contest practice. Many have heard the saying, “Practice what you preach.” It is time for believers to take that advice seriously. 

#### Learning Cycle 

##### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Psalm 119:9–11 

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Committed stewardship incorporates practices and habits that demonstrate a life dedicated to Christ. 

**Just for Teachers**: A high school track-and-field coach once interviewed a prospective athlete who boasted that she could high-jump five feet six inches, which is quite impressive. Her performance, however, was quite different. After the first two track meets (competitions), she was ready to quit because she had not been able to jump the entering height, which was only three feet six inches—two feet lower than her boast of five feet six inches. 

Nevertheless, she persisted, returning to jumping fundamentals. She practiced each component of jumping repeatedly. She mastered her approach steps, perfected her arc, and transformed the jumping functions into intuitive habits. She established the school high jump record that year and placed third at state championships. The following year she established the district championship meet record (five feet three inches) and was runner-up at state championships. Following graduation, she was recruited by top universities. 

Practice converted a dreamer into a winner. Many dream of doing great things for God, but it is those who perfect spiritual habits through repetitive practice who actually succeed. 

**Opening Discussion**: Ask if there are any athletes (current or former) in the class and ascertain the sports in which they excel or their fields of athletic prowess. Inquire of them as to what habits should be practiced in order to succeed in that athletic endeavor. Next, ask about the vocations and professions represented by class members. What habits do people practice in those fields in order to be successful? Discuss the specific spiritual goals of class members. What habits should believers practice in order to achieve those goals? 

##### STEP 2—Explore 

**Just for Teachers**: Most definitions of the word habit relate to regularly repeated patterns of action and behavior. Negatively framed, we sometimes call these actions addictions and oftentimes associate them with obsessions. Patterns, however, are not necessarily negative. Forming good habits, positive patterns, is required from those who would progress in spiritual development. Our study this week concentrates on several habits that are characteristic of devoted stewards. 

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. God First** (Review Exodus 20:3; Jeremiah 29:13; Matthew 6:33; 22:37, 38; Acts 17:28; Ephesians 5:15–17; Colossians 3:23; Luke 12:35–48; and Hebrews 10:25; 11:10 with the class.) 

Seeking God first demonstrates trust. Such trust is demonstrated in a committed prayer life. Morning prayers and meditations have fueled the spiritual lives of numerous believers. These devout souls routinely schedule God first during the day. In this way, Christians make God their first priority. The Bible tells us that God precedes all other things in life (Matt. 6:33), supersedes governments (Col. 1:16), and must be preferred above family and even life itself (Luke 14:26). 

In the same way, the tithing principle places God first above finances. Trusting God, therefore, forms the central characteristic of stewardship. In addition to trusting God, Christian stewards are also forward-looking. Put another way, Christianity is the world’s most hopeful, forward-looking religion. By way of example, when we explore Scripture, we find that dreams, aspirations, promises, expectations, and possibilities abound. And throughout the inspired writings of the Bible, the promise of Christ’s promised return outshines the rest. It surfaces repeatedly. This promise inspires believers with enthusiasm. As a result, we are infused with purpose, meaning, personal significance, and belonging. These benedictions extend to us from our divine family membership as a result of our trust in this promise. As part of the divine family, we await the Master’s return, anticipating His coming through faithful obedience to His instructions. Considering God’s wonderful promises, why would anyone think of putting Christ second? 

**Consider This**: What things might we reasonably expect if we seek God first? 

**II. Time Management** (Review Job 8:9; James 4:14; Psalms 39:4, 5; 90:10, 12; and Ephesians 5:15, 16 with the class.) 

Humans can neither reverse time nor relive the past. Time wasted today cannot be recaptured. Obviously, time is our most valuable asset. How should time be utilized? 

To answer this profound question, let us turn to God’s law and the fourth commandment, which is the only commandment that deals with time. The fourth commandment enjoins both work and rest. The command says work six days and rest one. Israel was different from other ancient societies in utilizing the seven-day week. Jesus’ custom or habit was to worship on that rest day, called the Sabbath. Likewise, Paul habitually worshiped on Sabbath (Acts 17:1, 2). The annual Jewish calendar maintained this balance between work and spiritual/physical rest, enjoined in the fourth commandment, stipulating feasts and a fast, planting times and harvesting times. There were times for family celebrations, such as the wedding feast at Cana (John 2), an event that Jesus honored with His presence (time). 

Work, family, rest, and worship seem to be the dominant themes of the fourth commandment. What seems missing—overtly, at least—is explicit instruction regarding leisure and entertainment. Contemporary culture, through technological advancements that have lessened our workload, has filled that emptiness with entertainment, much of which is pointless at best and destructive at worst. But it could be argued that the fourth commandment provides sacred principles that we can apply to our use of leisure time and that we can use to govern our recreational activities. 

**Consider This**: What principles does the fourth commandment teach us about how we are to spend our week? How do the Scriptures show that entertainment must either serve and conform in spirit to the fundamental uses of time, outlined in Scripture, or be avoided? 

**III. Healthful Habits** (Review 3 John 1–3, Revelation 21:1–5, and 1 Corinthians 9:24–27 with the class.) 

Work (exercise) balanced by rest (Sabbath) was established during Creation before sin’s entrance (Gen. 2:3–15). Counsel regarding beverage consumption (Prov. 20:1, 23:29–35), sexual morality (Leviticus 18 and 1 Cor. 6:18– 20), various diseases (for example, Leviticus 14), plus additional counsel regarding other physical issues underscores the importance of establishing healthful habits. Christian stewardship demands it. 

Paul admired athletic discipline and used running to illustrate spiritual principles related to self-control (1 Cor. 9:24–27, 2 Tim. 4:7, Heb. 12:1–3). God’s promise to ancient Israel is equally meaningful for modern Israel: “ ‘If you diligently heed the voice of the Lordyour God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians. For I am the Lordwho heals you’ ” (Exod. 15:26, NKJV). 

**Consider This**: How do the Scriptures for review and in this commentary section show the mind-body connection? How do the laws governing diet, sexual relations, and the Sabbath commandment serve as preventive measures that guard against disease and promote health? 

##### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: Should the linguistic linkage between the words disciple and discipline surprise us? How could Christ sanction undisciplined disciples? Could a greater oxymoron exist? Clearly, authentic Christians will experience discipline through every aspect of stewardship—spiritual, physical, mental, financial, emotional, and otherwise. 

To these practical virtues others might be added. Lists of Christian habits and practices occur in Galatians 5, the first chapter of 2 Peter, and other places. While this week’s study is obviously not exhaustive, it has supplied an opportunity to concentrate on some fundamental practices that should be present in the life of every believer. 

**Thought/Application Questions**: 

- How can believers cultivate those habits that are essential to stewards? ® How can physical discipline contribute toward spiritual attainment? ¯ How can disciples improve their time use when so many live with hectic schedules? 
- How can maintaining balanced lifestyles help Christians become more effective stewards? ± How might scriptural immersion and prayer help believers keep Christ and His coming uppermost in their thoughts? ² Outside the Bible, what are some resources that the Christian can use to maintain focus on spiritual things? 

##### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: New positive habits are not easily formed. Unfortunately, negative habits develop all too easily. God’s authority over everything, however, forms the believer’s unbeatable safeguard. Paul writes, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Phil. 4:13, NKJV). 

**Activity**: 

- Conduct a self-inventory regarding the areas that were studied this week. Where are your strengths? Be honest about your weaknesses. In what actions might you choose to change course? What practices would help to maintain your strengths? Write down your thoughts so that you may reference them later.
