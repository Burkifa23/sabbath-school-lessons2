#### The Lesson in Brief 

**Key Text**: Matthew 13:22

**The Student Will**:

- **Know**: Recognize the deceitfulness of riches and consumerism, thus enabling him or her to escape Satan’s grasp.
- **Feel**: Experience self-control or, better still, God’s control in the areas of desires, wants, and ambitions.
- **Do**: Develop plans for a lifestyle that is centered on contentment and gratitude for God’s generous provision.

**Learning Outline**:

1. Know: Recognizing Deceitful Riches
+ Why is it so easy to pass judgment regarding the possessions others accumulate, yet be so blind when it comes to our own spiritual condition?
+ Why has the prosperity gospel of many televangelists been so successful in diverting the attention of the church away from making disciples to accumulating wealth?
+ What are the three steps in the process of coveting?

2. Feel: Experiencing Self-Control
+ How can we experience the Holy Spirit’s control over our wants and desires when discontent is everywhere we turn?
+ What attitudes about life can nourish the gentle and meek spirit that naturally fosters contentment?

3. Do: Planning a Contented Life
+ What are the essential elements of a lifestyle plan that will perpetuate a contented life?
+ How can we separate needs from wants, necessities from preferences, or basics from embellishments?
+ What are some fundamental daily practices that should be incorporated into one’s lifestyle in order to implement successfully a godly lifestyle plan?

**Summary**: To replace greed with contentment, we must make those choices that allow God full control over our lives.

#### Learning Cycle

##### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Matthew 13:22

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The deceitfulness of riches will inevitably overtake us if we are not daily surrendered to the influence of the Holy Spirit.

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s study furthers the themes introduced in our prior study, focusing now on the emotional impact of materialism: dissatisfaction, discontent, greediness, coveting, fantasizing about (and loving) material things. What study could be more appropriate for the age in which we live? Regarding the last days, Jesus warned: “ ‘Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness and the anxieties of life’ ” (Luke 21:34, NIV, emphasis supplied). While adultery and murder have never been acceptable parts of the Christian lifestyle, other destructive sins have assumed more acceptable guises, such as greed and covetousness. Only the work of the Holy Spirit is capable of rescuing us from this self-deceit.

**Opening Discussion**: Compare the following two stories: The first story is about a man who was relatively healthy. He exercised regularly, watched what he ate, and looked a little younger than his actual age. Many considered him a model of health. He probably should have gotten more sleep, and he indulged his sweet tooth more often than not, but, generally, he seemed in good shape. His wife urged him to get a professional checkup periodically, but he either did not have the time or did not see the need and refused. Little did he realize that something was taking place in his body that would eventually kill him. By the time his cancer was detected, it was already stage 4. It was too late to save him.

Another man, whose health was not quite as good, paid attention to his aches and pains and sought a doctor’s advice. Tests revealed a cancerous growth at stage 1. Vigorous, and sometimes painful, treatment was applied, saving the man’s life. How important is it that the sinful diseases of materialism and worldly conformity be diagnosed early before they become deadly?

##### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: Covetousness and greed have oftentimes compromised the Christian’s witness and diverted resources that might otherwise have been invested in God’s cause. When these ills are allowed to flourish in the believers’ lives undetected, human energy and financial resources are misused for selfish purposes. The saddest part of all is that these sins are undetected. Murderers know they have killed. Adulterers know their sins. But very often the covetous and greedy live in “blissful ignorance” of their sinfulness. Only careful examination of our motives and practices, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, can reveal our true condition. The Laodicean church thought itself rich and prosperous when, in reality, it was pitiable, spiritually poor, and blind to its true condition.

**Bible Commentary**

**I. Distorted Theology and Practice** (Review Matthew 13:3–7, 22 with the class.)

Jesus presents a picture of spiritual life in Matthew 13:3–7 that opens with tremendous promise but fizzles with disappointing outcomes. No chance exists for the first group mentioned in this passage, because there is no spiritual receptivity (the birds eat the seed). The second group fares better but lacks adequate resources to grow the seed beyond a sprout. The third group has spiritual receptivity and the resources needed for growth; but before it grows, those resources are diverted into materialism, and spiritual things are choked out.  

The best gardens are those in which the gardener has taken the time to weed carefully. Otherwise, the weeds steal the nutrients intended for the vegetable plant, and it is either starved or choked out. Unfortunately, there is a popular strain of theology that cultivates selfishness under the guise of building faith. Known as prosperity theology, this false theology, like any good counterfeit, contains some truth that is carefully woven together with deceit. God does want us to prosper (3 John 2) and has materially blessed many believers throughout history (Abraham, Job, and Boaz, to name a few). The problem is that this theology teaches that our giving somehow obligates God to make us rich. The more we give, the more we get. The believer is motivated to give not out of spiritual principle, but by the selfish desire to get more money.

**Consider This**: What is it about the nature of materialism that makes it more difficult to detect than other sins? How is prosperity theology potentially damaging to the church?

**II. The Steps of Covetousness** (Review Genesis 3:1–6 with the class.)

The lesson identifies three distinct steps every person takes when falling into covetousness. 

First, we behold and fixate upon an object of desire, as our text for review illustrates. For example, Satan baits Eve with a display of the forbidden fruit, thus enticing her. Had Eve closed her eyes and immediately turned away, the entire course of human history would have been redirected. Our first defense is to look away. Potiphar’s wife’s infatuation with Joseph began as she “cast her eyes on Joseph” (Gen. 39:7, NRSV, emphasis supplied). The believer’s infatuation with materialism likewise begins with “eye casting.” James writes, “One is tempted by one’s own desire, being lured and enticed by it; then, when that desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin” (James 1:14, 15, NRSV). The secret to overcoming material temptation is to look away before it becomes sin. Jesus graphically underscored the importance of “eye control.” He said, “ ‘If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell’ ” (Matt. 5:29, NRSV). 

The second step is wanting. The ad company is not satisfied with showing you something. The industry spends millions researching how to make you want it. Will owning that item make you feel more valued and adored? Will it satisfy some basic longing for nourishment, sexual intimacy, or physical comfort? How can Christians withstand this manipulation that is funded by millions, if not billions, of dollars? The answers are found in a small book that can be purchased at many thrift stores for 50 cents: the Bible. James tells us to “submit to God” and to “draw near to God” (James 4:7, 8, NKJV). These foundations enable the actions he then proposes: (1) resist the devil, (2) cleanse your hands, and (3) purify your hearts (James 4:7, 8, NKJV). 

It is not enough, however, to protect the perimeter of the soul. Jesus suggested that the inside must be filled (Matt. 12:43–45). The void that materialism often fills must be occupied with spiritual realities. “Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth” (Col. 3:2, NRSV). Our desire for heavenly realities guards against an obsession with material things. 

The final step of falling into covetousness is the action step, the purchase point: I take. Even if we have compromised the first two, there is still hope. “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Phil. 4:13, NKJV). Rather than taking, we can focus our energies on giving, as Christ gave and in the way He commanded us to give. (See 1 John 3:16, 17 and Matt. 25:31–46.)

**Consider This**: Why is it easier to turn away from greed at the first step rather than the third?

##### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: The practice of scriptural meditation, prayer, and Christian service forms barriers against our natural tendencies toward covetousness. Through self-control—which, for the Christian, is nothing less than completely surrendering to divine control—our thoughts, passions, and energies may be directed to use God’s material blessings in accordance with His will. We must remember that God’s creation of material things invests them with His blessing. These are not inherently evil. When we worship God’s creation instead of worshiping God Himself, it is then that problems arise.

**Thought/Application Questions**: 

1. Because self-control is essentially the surrender to divine control, what practical things might be done to clear away obstacles to the Holy Spirit? 
2. How might the cultivation of other spiritual gifts contribute to the development of the self-control that is needed to overcome covetousness?
3. What are some useful approaches for applying self-control to each of the three steps that lead to covetousness?

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: One way that believers “set their minds on things above” to fill the space occupied by materialism is to focus on Jesus. One way to focus on Jesus is to share the good news and care for “the least of these” (Matt. 25:40), for by so doing we are serving Jesus Himself. Plan activities that help us focus on Jesus through service.
