#### Praying for a Hindu Family

_by Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission_

Arpita Bhosale, a 14-year-old student at a Seventh-day Adventist school in western India, lost her Hindu father when a truck rear-ended his ox cart.

The force of the impact caused her father, Roasaheb Bhosale, to fly forward, over the two oxen and onto the road, where he was struck by another vehicle.

The shock of his death caused her mother, who is deaf and mute, to go into labor prematurely. Arpita Bhosale was born a month early.

“But God was able to use my father’s death to lead my mother to Jesus,” Bhosale said in an interview at the Alate Seventh-day Adventist School, located about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from Kohlapur, a bustling city of more than one million people.

Bhosale spent the first few months of her life in the hospital with her mother, Akkatai. Both she and her mother were sickly. The grave situation worried her mother’s brother, Satish, who visited the hospital daily.

One Saturday when Satish arrived to encourage his sister, he saw a stranger going from bed to bed, praying with the patients. Satish curiously approached the man and learned that he was an Adventist pastor. 

“My uncle was Hindu,” Bhosale said. “But he was desperate to help my mother, so he asked the pastor to pray for her.”

The pastor prayed for both the woman and her baby. Satish used sign language to interpret the pastor’s words to his sister.

As the pastor visited the mother and baby regularly, the pair started to recover. Amazed, Satish quizzed the pastor about his faith, Bhosale said. After several months of Bible study, both Satish and his sister were baptized. The mother dedicated her daughter to the Lord and, from the time when the child began to talk, taught her to pray at 7 p.m. daily.

“Every day at 7 p.m. I fold my hands and pray no matter where I am,” said Bhosale, now a seventh-grade dormitory student at the Alate Adventist School, which received funds to build a new classroom building from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering in third quarter 2017. “I’ve been doing this for as long as I can remember.”

Bhosale herself was baptized at 13.

“I decided to be baptized because I’ve seen how Jesus has blessed my family through the Seventh-day Adventist Church,” Bhosale said. “I want to follow Jesus because of my mother’s life story. I’ve seen everything that Jesus has done for her.”
