What is an honest heart, and how is it revealed? Contemporary culture often views honesty as some vague, relativistic ethic; most people are occasionally dishonest but consider it acceptable as long as the infringement is not too great. Also specific circumstances, it is claimed, could justify some dishonesty.

Truth and honesty are always together. Yet, we were not born with an inclination to be honest; it is a learned moral virtue and is at the core of a steward’s moral character.

When we practice honesty good things come of it. For instance, there is never a worry about being caught in a lie or then having to cover it up. For this reason and more, honesty is a valuable personality trait, especially under difficult situations when the temptation might easily be toward dishonesty.

In this week’s lesson we will study the spiritual concept of honesty through the practice of tithing and see why tithing is vitally important to the steward and stewardship.
