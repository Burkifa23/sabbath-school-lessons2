#### A Gift in the Forest: Part 2

The Polish Union decided to rent the camp, and soon a truck from Denmark arrived, filled with military surplus beds and dressers and kitchen supplies! The union stepped out in faith and started holding camps at Zatonie. 

Ryszard [ree-SHARD] went to the local village council and explained that the church wanted the campsite to train children and youth to be good citizens. He reported on how the church already had used the camp to benefit children from a coal mining region and children whose homes had been destroyed during recent flooding. He explained the purpose of Pathfinder camps and youth camps. Then he asked the council to consider giving the camp to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. One member of the local council objected, but in the end the council voted overwhelmingly to give Camp Zatonie to the Adventist Church. A gift from Adventists in Britain paid for the buildings (which were privately owned). God had spoken. 

Besides summer camps for youth, the campground hosts Poland’s annual camp meeting. Hundreds of people who are not Adventists come to this camp, and many leave having turned their lives over to Jesus. 

Children are encouraged to bring non-Adventist friends to camp, and some of these young people have decided to follow Jesus. Literature evangelists use the camp as a training site for colporteurs, who practice their sales skills in the villages around Zatonie. 

When Ryszard first found Zatonie, he noticed some words written on a building: “God doesn’t exist.” Two years later during a camp meeting, he asked the youth what should be done about the graffiti. A young man stood and said that he had written those words in 1989 while at a camp for troubled teenagers. When he returned home, he learned that one of his friends had become an Adventist. The friend invited him to church, and in time, he, too, gave his life to Christ. God took away his desire to drink and smoke and made him into a new person. So this young man who had written the words against God on the wall during a drunken act of rebellion helped to paint over them as a brother in Christ. 

In 2010, part of your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering went to renovate the buildings at Camp Zatonie. Part of this quarter’s offering will fund live television productions aimed specifically at children and youth on Hope Channel Poland. Thank you for your support through the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering.

Ryszard Jankowski, now president of the West Polish Conference, was Polish Union youth director when Zatonie’s story unfolded.
