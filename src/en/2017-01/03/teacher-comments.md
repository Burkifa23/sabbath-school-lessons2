#### **Learning Cycle**

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Just as the earthly tabernacle was a dwelling place for the Shekinah glory of God, our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, designed to reveal God’s glory through godly lives. The amazing truth of Scripture is that the God of the universe longs to dwell in our hearts through the Person of the Holy Spirit.

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s lesson is crucial to our understanding of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the life of each Christian. Understanding that the Holy Spirit is the Third Person of the Godhead with the attributes of the Father and Son makes a major difference in how we relate to the role of the Holy Spirit in our lives. The Holy Spirit is not some force to be used. He is not some power to be sought after. He is a divine Member of the Godhead to whom we open our hearts and surrender our lives. We are not to use the Holy Spirit. He is to use us to testify of the glory of the crucified, risen, and soon-coming Christ.

The attributes of God are the attributes of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is all-knowing, all-powerful, omnipresent, and eternal (1 Cor. 2:10, 11; Pss. 104:30; 139:7; Heb. 9:14). To be filled with the Spirit is to be filled with the presence of God. The indwelling of the Spirit is the indwelling of the Father’s presence in the temple of our hearts. It is God dwelling within us through His Holy Spirit.

**Opening Discussion:** Throughout the Bible, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are linked in an indissoluble union (Matt. 28:18, 19; 1 Pet. 1:2; 2 Cor. 13:14). They cooperated in the work of Creation and Redemption. In what ways is Their work similar? How is Their work different? Which of these Three is prominent in the Old Testament era? Who among Them is the most prominently featured in the four Gospels? Why? Which One is in the forefront in the book of Acts?

Some have called the book of Acts “The Acts of the Holy Spirit.” Throughout the book of Acts and the epistles of Paul, the Holy Spirit is present as the Third Person of the Godhead, convicting the soul of sin, instructing in righteousness, testifying of Jesus, and changing lives. Writing to Titus, the apostle Paul declares that we are saved “not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit” (Titus 3:5, NKJV). It is through the Holy Spirit that our hearts are renewed, our lives changed, and our souls refreshed.

**Questions for Discussion:** 

1. When you think of the Holy Spirit, what thoughts immediately come to mind? Share with the class a few phrases that enter your mind when you think of the Holy Spirit. 

2. How does an understanding of who the Holy Spirit is make a difference in your life? In what practical ways does this knowledge make a difference to us?


#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: Throughout the New Testament, the Holy Spirit is described as the divine regenerating, sanctifying, life-changing, and life-giving Agent (Titus 3:5, 1 Pet. 1:2, 2 Cor. 3:6). In Romans 8, the apostle Paul talks about living in the flesh and living in the Spirit. Living in the flesh is the vain attempt to live the Christian life in our own strength rather than in the power of the Holy Spirit. Living in the Spirit is living a life of surrender to the Spirit’s convictions and claims. It is dying daily to the desires of the carnal heart and being renewed by the sanctifying grace of the Spirit. 

Crucifixion is an exceedingly painful death. Christ’s crucifixion certainly was. Christ died for our sins; but through the Holy Spirit, we die to sin. Sin no longer is a way of life for the converted heart. Our soul’s longing is to please Jesus, and this desire is accomplished through the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit. 

### **Bible Commentary**

1. **Understanding the Divinity of the Holy Spirit** (Review 1 Peter 1:2 and Romans 15:19 with the class.)

What are the characteristics of God? What makes God, God? First, He is eternal. He never had a beginning and will never have an ending. He is the great “ ‘I AM’ ” (Exod. 3:14, NKJV). He is the One “who is and who was and who is to come” (Rev. 1:4). The fact that God has existed from eternity sets Him apart from all created beings in the universe. He is also omniscient or all-knowing (Dan. 2:20–22). There is nothing that an all-wise God does not know. His knowledge is neither limited nor partial. He is both omnipresent and omnipotent, as well. His Presence can be felt everywhere (Psalm 139). His power is limitless. He is the eternal, all-knowing, all-powerful, and omnipresent God. The idea of the future being “open,” in that there are some things God cannot know before they happen, is alien to the Bible.

Here is an amazing truth. The same qualities that are attributed to God in Scripture are also attributed to the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is also eternal (Heb. 9:14). He is all-knowing, all-powerful, and omnipresent (1 Cor. 2:10, 11; Rom. 15:19; Ps. 139:7). The Father and Son are present with us, providing all the resources of heaven through the ministry of the Holy Spirit.

As children of God, we have been promised the wisdom and the power of the Spirit. Through the Spirit, we have the assurance of eternal life and hope beyond the grave (Rom. 8:12–17). If the Holy Spirit were not divine, how could He offer us divine wisdom, sanctifying grace, life-changing power, and eternal hope? If the Holy Spirit were a mere force, He certainly could not offer us the assurance of eternal life. The eternal nature of the Godhead is absolutely critical in our understanding of the significance of the Holy Spirit for Christian living.

Explore with your class the practical implications that the Holy Spirit is eternal, all-knowing, all-powerful, and omnipresent. What do His attributes mean in day-to-day Christian living?

**Consider This:** Why are these attributes of the Holy Spirit so important in facing the temptations of the evil one? Why do some theologians declare that belief in the Holy Spirit is one of the most misunderstood truths in the Bible and that if we had a better understanding of who He is and how to experience His life-changing power, the grip of sin on our lives would be broken?

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: We often struggle with the same selfish attitudes, the same harmful habits, and the same sinful tendencies for years. Help your class to understand the renewing, sanctifying, life-changing power of the Holy Spirit as the Third Person of the Godhead.

**Application Questions:** 

1. How can we experience the life-changing power of the Holy Spirit that the Scriptures describe? 
2. What are the things in our lives that distract us and keep us from enjoying the fullness of the Holy Spirit’s power?
3. What can we do about these distractions? What is the key to victory over these lifelong habits, attitudes, and behaviors that are not in harmony with God’s will?

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s lesson is especially designed to help each class member understand the divine power of the Holy Spirit as the Third Person of the Godhead. Help your class to understand with clarity this vital truth for Christian living.

**Activities:** 

1. If supplies are available, provide a pencil and an index card to each class member. Invite the class members to write in one sentence the most significant thing they learned in class this week.
2. As an encouragement to the class, ask members to read the sentence they have written. Where supplies are unavailable, invite students to share their thoughts aloud with the class.
