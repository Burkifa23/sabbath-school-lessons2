> “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love  of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all” (2 Corinthians 13:14, NASB). 

A ll through the Bible, the deity of God the Father is simply assumed. We find this truth expressed both in the Old Testament and in		the New Testament. It is one of the most crucial and foundational of the many revealed truths in the Word of God.

The deity of Jesus also is affirmed in many places in Scripture, especially, of course, in the New Testament, both in the Gospels and the Epistles. 

However, the deity of the Holy Spirit is taught in more subtle terms. It can be inferred from various indirect biblical statements. Here we need to compare scripture with scripture in order to study carefully what God has revealed in His Word about the Holy Spirit. In doing so, we should not affirm less than what Scripture states, and we also should not “exceed what is written” (1 Cor. 4:6, NASB). This topic demands a teachable attitude of humility; we should not make our human reasoning about God the standard of how the Holy Spirit should be understood. Instead, we should accept and testify to what Scripture affirms, no matter how hard some of the concepts might be for us to grasp fully.
