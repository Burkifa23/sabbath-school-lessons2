#### A Place to Belong

Leila awoke with a heavy heart. It was Sabbath, and she was homesick. She remembered her mother and brother, who would be going to church today. 

In Kenya, it seemed that nearly everyone went to church. But in Denmark, where Leila now lived, it seemed that few people attended the fine churches scattered across the city. In fact, she had been so busy in the two months since she had arrived that she hadn’t thought much about finding a church either. 

Leila had come to Copenhagen to visit her aunt. When the woman suggested that Leila find work as an au pair (a live-in babysitter), Leila agreed. She obtained the necessary visa and found a job with a wonderful family who treated her well. She began saving money to attend college when she returned home. But she hadn’t found a church home. 

Suddenly, she turned on the computer and searched for a Seventh-day Adventist church in Copenhagen. She was thrilled to discover an international Adventist congregation that worshiped in the city. Quickly, she copied down the address. But how could she get there? Her aunt wasn’t an Adventist, so Leila decided to take the bus. She found a map and hurried to catch the bus. 

Arriving at the place where the Adventists normally met, Leila was dismayed to find the room empty! Then she noticed a letter explaining that the members were on a retreat. The letter gave directions, so Leila hurried to catch a bus to the region outside the city where the retreat was being held. 

She got lost several times before she found the retreat center and arrived just as the sermon was ending. But Leila didn’t care. She had found fellow believers!

She met Rose from Uganda, who invited her to join her for lunch. Rose introduced Leila to other members of the English-speaking church. She met people from around the world—Iceland, Philippines, Tanzania, and America, as well as from Denmark. The members welcomed her warmly and invited her to join them the next Sabbath, and Leila was determined not to miss another Sabbath of fellowship and worship!

Leila rejoices that she has found her spiritual home in Denmark in the international congregation. She feels loved and nurtured there and in turn welcomes and nurtures others who come. 

The international English-language church in Copenhagen represents Adventists from at least 16 countries, yet they find unity and fellowship in their adopted country and their new church home. A portion of your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering in 2010 helped to provide funds for a new place of worship for this international Adventist congregation. Thank you!
