### _The Lesson in Brief_

**Key Text**: John 14:16–18, 16:5–15

#### **The Student Will:**
- **Know:** Recognize the importance of understanding that the Holy Spirit is a divine Personality, not merely a force proceeding from the Father.
- **Feel:** Experience a deeper appreciation of, and dependence on, the Holy Spirit’s ministry in daily living.
- **Do:** Develop sensitivity to the voice of the Spirit and a more complete openness to responding to His leading.

#### **Learning Outline:**
1. Know: The Holy Spirit Is Just as Much a Divine Person as Are the Father and the Son. 
   + **A** What attributes of personality does the Bible ascribe to the Holy Spirit?
   + **B** How do you define “personhood”? What makes a person a person? How do the qualities of the Holy Spirit, found in the Bible, give evidence of these traits?
2. Feel: The Holy Spirit Longs to Fill Each Believer.
   + **A** Why is it so important to recognize that the Holy Spirit is the Third Person of the Godhead and as much a divine Personality as are the Father and the Son?
   + **B** How do you feel knowing that Jesus has not left us orphans but longs to be personally present with us through the ministry of the Holy Spirit?
3. Do: The Holy Spirit Longs to Reveal Jesus More Fully.
   + **A** The highest delight and greatest joy of the Holy Spirit is to “testify” of Jesus in our lives. Determine to set aside time each day to read some portion of the Gospels in order to give the Spirit space to glorify Jesus in your life. What have you found most helpful in your own spiritual life to allow you time to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit?
   + **B** What specific experiences could you share with the class regarding times in which the Holy Spirit has revealed God’s love? How have they been specifically meaningful to you?
 
**Summary:** When we open our hearts to the ministry of the Holy Spirit, realizing that He is the personal Representative of Christ, the Third Person of the Godhead, He will reveal Jesus to us in all of His beauty and glorify the living Christ in our lives.

#### **Learning Cycle**

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: John 16:7

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: The Holy Spirit is not limited by time or place. Whenever we need Him, He is there. Wherever we go in Christ’s name, He will be there, guiding, counseling, encouraging, strengthening, and inspiring us with hope. As we grasp the reality of the Spirit’s daily, continual presence, our hearts will be overjoyed.

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s lesson unfolds the personality of the Holy Spirit throughout Scripture. Some want to deny that the Holy Spirit is the Third Person of the Godhead. They believe that the Holy Spirit is a force or an essence that proceeds from the Father, not a distinct Being and divine Personality.

In our study this week, we will systematically review the Bible passages that clearly demonstrate both the divine nature and Personhood of the Holy Spirit. Three basics of personality are a mind that reasons, a will that chooses, and speech that communicates. The Holy Spirit possesses all three. We will examine the first two in more depth in this lesson.

**Opening Discussion:** When you think of the Holy Spirit, what do you think of ? How clear is your own thinking on the nature, role, and ministry of the Holy Spirit? It certainly is much easier to think of the Father and Son as divine Personalities than it is to think of the Holy Spirit as such. 

We often equate visibility with personhood. It is difficult to imagine a person who is invisible. The nature of the Holy Spirit is a mystery. Infinite things are difficult for the human mind to comprehend; but just because we do not fully understand something does not mean that the thing we do not fully understand does not exist.

**Questions for Discussion:** 

1. Why is understanding the nature of the Holy Spirit so important?
2. Why do God’s people need the ministry of the Holy Spirit in their daily lives?
3. What can we learn from Jesus’ description of the Holy Spirit in John 16:13, 14?


#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: When we approach divine mysteries, it is important to discover what the Bible says and to be willing to leave unanswered what it does not say. In this week’s lesson, we will focus on what the Bible teaches on the divine Personality of the Holy Spirit, finding encouragement and strength for our lives today. 

### **Bible Commentary**

1. **I. “Called to One’s Side”: The Holy Spirit as Helper and Comforter** (Review John 14–16 with the class.)

In Jesus’ discussion of the Holy Spirit in John 14–16, He uses the term “ ‘Helper’ ” (NKJV) or “Comforter” (KJV) on four separate occasions (John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7). The Greek term used in these passages is parakl-etos, which literally means “ ‘called to one’s side,’ i.e., to one’s aid.”—Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words, s.v. “parakletos,” accessed March 29, 2016

In an ancient court of law, when someone was tried, this person was assigned a parakl-etos, who would come to this person’s aid and provide for the needs of this person. (Ibid.) These needs might be physical, such as the need for food, blankets, or water. Additionally, they might be emotional or psychological needs, such as the need for encouragement and hope. Or they might be legal needs, such as the need for a defense or an advocate when the charges were brought forward in court. 

What an image to use in order to describe the Holy Spirit: One who comes alongside of us to meet our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs! There is never a situation that we face as God’s children when He is not there. There is never an experience with which we are confronted that He is incapable of handling. Our divine Helper is always there, ready to help in our times of need. 

**Consider This:** What is the original Greek term for Holy Spirit that is used in John 14:16, and what does that literally mean? How does its meaning help us understand more fully the concept of the Holy Spirit as both Helper and Comforter? How does He come to our aid? What needs does He fulfill?

2. **The Person of the Holy Spirit** (Review Romans 8:27 and 1 Corinthians 12:11 with the class.)

The apostle Paul uses two amazing terms to describe the Holy Spirit’s divine Personhood: “mind” and “will.” In Romans 8:27, Paul speaks of the “mind of the Spirit” (NKJV). In 1 Corinthians 12:11, he points out that the Holy Spirit gives spiritual gifts to each believer individually “as He wills.” The mind and the will are two unique functions of personhood. Let’s look more closely at the mind and the will in the Bible, as presented in the context of human believers and Christ, to infer more fully what it means for the Holy Spirit to be endowed with both. 

The mind is the center of thought. It is here that reason, conscience, and judgment influence decisions. The Bible uses the word mind to embody concepts of holiness, unity, and soundness of mind—qualities believers are urged to aspire to and pray for. For example, the Bible tells us we may have the mind of Christ (Phil. 2:5, 1 Cor. 2:16), which is to say, His holy character. And when speaking of the need for unity among believers, the Bible urges us to be of the “same mind” (Rom. 12:16, Phil. 4:2) and “one mind” (2 Cor. 13:11). Coming into Christ’s presence imparts soundness of mind, as the story of the demoniac powerfully illustrates. Subsequently, when the demons are cast out, the demoniac is found to be in his “right mind” (Mark 5:15, Luke 8:35), a phrase that also can be translated from the Greek to mean “to be of sound mind.”—Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words, s.v. “sophroneo,” accessed March 29, 2016.

Just as the endowment of a mind is a defining characteristic of personhood for both the human and the divine, so is the will. Animals have minds. But the will, or the ability to make rational choices, lifts us above the animal creation. Being endowed with a will reflects part of what it means to be fashioned in the image of God. We are not merely creatures, propelled by instinct and driven by biological desires. God has given each of us the capacity to make moral choices through the right exercise of the will. Ellen G. White states it succinctly: “The will is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of decision, or choice. Every human being possessed of reason has power to choose the right. In every experience of life, God’s word to us is, ‘Choose you this day whom ye will serve.’ Joshua 24:15. Every one may place his will on the side of the will of God, may choose to obey Him, and by thus linking himself with divine agencies, he may stand where nothing can force him to do evil.”—Education, p. 289. It is through the right exercise of the will, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, that a godly character is developed. 

Because the Holy Spirit has both a divine mind that thinks and reasons and a divine will that chooses, He must, by very definition, be a divine Person. He is not merely a force that proceeds from the Father, one aspect of God’s personality. He is a separate, distinct Personality. The Holy Spirit thinks, reasons, makes decisions, and chooses. He is as much a real and divine Personality as are the Father and the Son.

**Consider This:** Define the characteristics of personhood and why, based on these criteria, the Holy Spirit—mysterious though He may be—fulfills the definition of personhood.

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: Lead your class into a practical discussion of how the Holy Spirit reveals the truth of God’s Word and how Jesus is “ ‘the way, the truth, and the life’ ” (John 14:6, NKJV). If Jesus is “ ‘truth,’ ” what does He mean when He says to His disciples that the Holy Spirit will lead them into “ ‘all truth’ ” (John 16:13)?

**Application Questions:** 

1. When we seek the Holy Spirit to be in our midst, we are not seeking some cosmic force to guide us. When we seek guidance from the Holy Spirit, we are not hoping for a mystical presence to lead us to some inner light. We are asking the God of the universe to send the Third Person of the Godhead to give us the support we need. Why does the Holy Spirit seem so mysterious at times? How can He become more real in our lives?
2. What can we do as individuals to be more sensitive to the working of the Holy Spirit in our lives?
3. What practical things can we do to hear the voice of God speaking through the Holy Spirit as we read God’s Word?

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: The Holy Spirit is a powerful Ally in overcoming sin and enabling us to live joyful and abundant Christian lives. The Holy Spirit is available to strengthen us as we face temptation, to encourage us in times of discouragement, and to guide us in times of decision. As we give the Holy Spirit permission to fill our lives with His divine presence, we will live life to the fullest rather than struggling in our own strength against the wiles of the evil one and living lives of frustrated defeat. We will rejoice in the victories that the Holy Spirit gives.

**Activities:** 

1. Ask your class to share the most significant thought they will take away from this week’s lesson.
2. Discuss with your class what it means to them personally that the Holy Spirit is our divine parakl-etos.
3. Invite your class to share ways they have found to hear the Spirit’s voice as they have meditated on the Word and works of God.
