#### Finding God’s Plan: Part 2

Roza continued attending the Seventh-day Adventist church, and she became convinced that this was where God wanted her to be. After attending the church for several months, Roza asked to be baptized.

Her parents were angry when she told them about her decision. For the first time in her life, her father hit her. And her mother demanded that she leave the house.

Roza packed a few clothes and her school textbooks and left her parents’ home. She went to stay with an Adventist family who lived nearby. Two weeks later Roza’s mother sent her sister to ask her to return home.

She was permitted to sleep in her own bed, but her parents no longer supported her financially. A scholarship paid her school tuition, but Roza took a job cleaning the church to pay for food and other necessities. She spent most of her time in class and studying in the school library, going home only to sleep. Roza managed to finish college on her own. 

Roza knew that her mother was worried about her. “How will you ever find a husband?” she asked. Roza knew her mother had a point, because there weren’t many Adventists in Poland. But she claimed God’s promises to provide for her in every way.

While Roza was preparing for baptism, she met Krystov [Chris-toff], a young man who lived in another city and also was planning to be baptized. The two began writing to each other, and in time they began dating. Eventually, they were married.

Krystov entered the ministry, and Roza began her career as a teacher. Her family saw that the couple was happy in their faith and in their work, and they have reconciled with their daughter. Roza hopes that one day soon her parents will find the joy in Jesus that she and Krystov know.

Roza is grateful to God for leading her to the Savior through the influence of her grandmother, a Bible lecture brochure, and a Bible camp filled with friendly youth who welcomed her.

 <p>Dear brothers and sisters,</p>

 <p>With great disappointment I would like to inform that Portuguese Publishing House (Publicadora SerVir) reached out to us and threatened with legal sanctions if we keep providing Portuguese Sabbath School lessons in our application.</p>

 <p>It is extremely sad that too witness our own church entities doing it. But it is the reality of the world we live in, and has been prophesied long time ago (Ephesians 6:12) – and many of our church leaders are blind to the true evangelism and has only one focus – money. Greed has overtaken their minds and conscience and it is not anything new, as it has been seen before (Matthew 21:12).</p>

 <p>Mission of Adventech ministry is to glorify God through technology.</p>
 <p>Mission of Adventech is to unite our Adventist church through technology.</p>
 <p>Mission of Adventech is to use technology to bring Good News to this world and see Jesus Coming Again!</p>

 <p>To date, our Sabbath School application is providing lessons in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and Japanese. It has over 300 000 installations. It is completely free of charge and that will never change. It is completely ad free and that will never change. Lesson is never modified from its source and that will never change. Adventech will continue doing everything possible to help brothers and sisters around the world read, study use Sabbath School. We will continue adding more languages to our application. We will continue to add more functionality and improve usability. Adventech will continue bringing talent together to create, innovate and deliver. Adventech will be building more applications!</p>

 <p>At this point Adventech ministry and me personally are praying for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, for if God is for us, who can be against us? (Romans 8:31). We do not support revolution or anything like that, but rely on God only – Romans 12:19. It is possible that more publishing houses will take path similar to Publicadora SerVir and Casa Publicadora Brasiliera – and try to stop our ministry.</p>

 <p>Because of that: we ask for your support in prayers! We ask for your support in prayers with your pastors! We ask for your support in prayers with your friends! We ask for your support in prayers with church leaders! We ask for your support in prayers for above mentioned publishing houses! We ask for your support in prayers to Jesus Christ!</p>

 <p>May God bless you all for the support.</p>
