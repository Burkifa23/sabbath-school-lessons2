#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Matthew 3:11

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: God longs to fill His people with His Holy Spirit, even if they may not fully understand the significance of the infilling and may not clearly grasp the steps of how to be filled with the Holy Spirit. The loving heart of Christ desires that we have all the benefits that Heaven offers in overcoming the wiles of the evil one and in living the most abundant lives possible. God is doing everything possible to enable us to be overcomers in the battle with evil.

**Just for Teachers**: This week’s lesson should help members of your class to be aware that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is not for a select few or a small group of spiritually elite Christians. The baptism or infilling of the Holy Spirit is for all believers in every generation. When we become insensitive to the infilling of the Holy Spirit, we live the Christian life in our own strength, powerless to overcome temptation. We live in frustrated defeat rather than in joyous victory. Our decisions are based on human wisdom rather than divine guidance. We are caught in the grip of seemingly unbreakable habits rather than enjoying the freedom that the Spirit of Christ brings.

**Opening Discussion:** Pastor Mark Finley, a Seventh-day Adventist evangelist, conducted a series of evangelistic meetings on the East Coast of America, in the state of Massachusetts. After one of the meetings, a young man in his late twenties approached Pastor Finley with a strange, concerned look on his face. He asked, “Can we talk privately? I have a very important question to ask you.” 

Pastor Finley invited the young man to be seated in a quiet corner of the auditorium for their discussion. The young man launched immediately into his concerns. Anxiously, he blurted out the questions, “How do I know if I have committed the unpardonable sin? Why do I feel so spiritually empty? Is this emptiness a sign that the Holy Spirit has left me?” Pastor Finley patiently answered the questions one by one until this young man had new assurance in Christ and a sense of the daily presence of the Holy Spirit in his life.

Here is the fundamental question: What is the difference between the unpardonable sin and the baptism of the Holy Spirit? They are two polarities on opposite sides of the Holy Spirit spectrum. Additionally, what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit? How is one literally “filled” with the Spirit? Why is the infilling of the Holy Spirit not simply an emotional experience? What kind of experience is it?


#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: The major themes of today’s lesson are (1) the baptism of the Holy Spirit, (2) the prerequisites to receiving the Holy Spirit, and (3) the difference the infilling of the Holy Spirit makes in the life of each believer. Under the larger umbrella of these themes, this commentary section will attempt to explore answers to the following questions: What is the baptism of the Holy Spirit? And what does John the Baptist mean when he points his hearers forward to Jesus, who would baptize them with “ ‘the Holy Spirit and fire’ ” (Matt. 3:11, NKJV)? Notice the Bible says, “and fire” not “or fire.” What does that distinction mean?

As your students explore the answers to these questions, it is important that they bear in mind that there are at least three prime ways that help in understanding a Bible passage:

First, urge class members to read the context of the passage. What comes before the text they are considering, and what comes after? 

Second, how are the words and concepts of this passage used in other places in the Bible? 

And third, what is the meaning of the words in the passage they are studying? (At times, it is helpful to look at the original language of the text. A good Bible commentary or dictionary can be useful here.)

Throughout the lesson, be sure to emphasize to your students that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is for all believers. Share the truth that baptism is immersion and that each one of us can be immersed daily in the presence of God through the ministry of the Holy Spirit. As we saturate our minds with the Word, we are filled with the Holy Spirit. The same Holy Spirit that inspired the Bible fills and transforms our lives as we read it.

### **Bible Commentary**

1. **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** (Review Matthew 3:11 with the class.)

Throughout the Bible, fire is used as a symbol of the presence of God. In Genesis 3:24, the presence of God guarding the tree of life is symbolized by a flaming sword. In Exodus, God’s presence is manifest in a burning bush (Exod. 3:2–4). It also is revealed in the pillar of fire that guides Israel by night (Exod. 13:21). God makes Himself manifest in the “consuming fire” on Mount Sinai (Exod. 24:17). He reveals Himself in the Shekinah glory in the Most Holy Place in Israel’s sanctuary (Exod. 25:8, 21, 22; 40:34–38). He is there in the fire that consumes the heathen altar on Mount Carmel, in the burning coal off heaven’s altar that touches Isaiah’s lips, and in the refining fire of Malachi (1 Kings 18:38; Isa. 6:6–8; Mal. 3:2, 3; 4:1).

As we can see throughout the Old Testament, God’s presence is revealed in the imagery of flaming fire. It is, therefore, no accident that in Acts 2 the presence of the Holy Spirit is revealed in tongues of fire. Throughout the New Testament, fire is a unique biblical symbol that represents the glory, majesty, and power of God’s eternal presence through the ministry of the Holy Spirit. 

Baptism in Scripture is neither sprinkling nor pouring. It is immersion. To be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be immersed in the presence of God. It is to be filled with His grace and to radiate His glory. It is to reveal to a waiting world and a watching universe the greatness of His power in our lives. It is to live in harmony with His will, to be committed to His ways, and to be surrendered to His purpose. Empowered by the Spirit, our lives are changed, and we are witnesses of His grace. When we are immersed in a water baptism as a testimony of our total commitment to Christ and His truth, we are also baptized by the Holy Spirit and experience the infilling of the Holy Spirit.

**Consider This**: Give examples from the Old and New Testaments of how fire is used to symbolize the presence of God.

_What does baptism mean? Define “immersion.” What does it mean to be baptized, or immersed, in the presence of God?_

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: The biblical conditions given in Scripture for the reception of the Holy Spirit are given not because God desires to hold back His Spirit from us but because He desires us to receive Him in His fullness. It is not that God is hesitant to give the Spirit; it is rather that we are incapable of receiving the Holy Spirit in His fullness without meeting the conditions.

**Thought Questions:**

1. God longs to fill us with His Holy Spirit and radically transform our lives more than we can ever imagine. His desire is that we live lives of victory, reflecting His goodness and proclaiming His love and power. What does the baptism of the Holy Spirit mean to you personally?
2. How has the Holy Spirit made a difference in your life? 
3. What are some practical principles in receiving the fullness of the Holy Spirit each day?

**Life Application Questions**:

Take each of the following conditions for the reception of the Holy Spirit individually, and discuss them with your class: 

1. Why is repentance a prerequisite to receiving the Holy Spirit?
2. What role does trusting God’s Word play in receiving the Holy Spirit?
3. How does obedience play a role in the reception of the Holy Spirit?
4. Why do you think God would not pour out His Holy Spirit on those who knowingly are disobedient to His will?
5. Why does impurity hinder the working of the Holy Spirit?

Activity: Ask members of your class to share Bible passages that are the most meaningful to them about the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives.

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: The essence of all Christian faith is Christ-centered living. If our faith does not make a difference in our daily lives, it does not make much difference at all. For faith to be genuine and authentic, it must make a difference in every aspect of our lives. This transformation is one of the reasons for the Holy Spirit. When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, our lives are changed and the people around us take notice.

**Activities:** 

1. What is the difference between the self-centered person and the Spirit-controlled person?
2. Read Galatians 5:16–26 meditatively, and ask God to reveal any area in your life that is not in complete harmony with His will. Spend a moment reflecting on what the Holy Spirit brings to your mind.
3. Surrender that area to Him and claim the promise of the Holy Spirit for victory.
