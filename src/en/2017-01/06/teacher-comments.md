   + **A** Is holiness a destination we achieve or a journey we are on as Christians? Explain.
   + **B** Why should the pursuit of holiness—to become loving and pure like Jesus—be the pursuit of every Christian?
3. Do: Determine by the Grace of God to Seek Holiness Through Prayer, the Study of the Word, and Christian Meditation.
   + **A** Compare the biblical expressions “walking in the Spirit” and “fighting the good fight of faith.” How are these statements similar, and how can you implement them in your life?

**Summary:** The pursuit of holiness is the calling of every Christian. When we seek holiness, we are seeking God Himself, who is holy. It is the Holy Spirit, the divine Helper, who comes to our aid to strengthen us in our pursuit of the holiness that is the very essence of the character of God.

#### **Learning Cycle**

#### STEP 1—Motivate

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Ephesians 1:3–6

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: God chose us before the foundation of the world. In Christ, He blessed us with every spiritual blessing so that we may reflect the grace of His character and seek His holiness. Holiness is not a state of perfection that we struggle to achieve. It is continually becoming more like Jesus, a state achieved daily through the power of the Holy Spirit as we fellowship with God in prayer and through His Word. Holiness is the result of beholding the beauty of Christ’s character.

**Just for Teachers**: God’s holiness consists largely of two major elements. First, it includes His righteous, pure character that is intrinsically part of His nature. God cannot act contrary to His own nature; so, His actions are always righteous, pure, and just. Second, God’s holiness sets Him apart from all created beings. His love, graciousness, goodness, justice, and compassion are infinite. There is no one else like Him in the entire universe (Lev. 19:2; Ps. 47:8; 1 Pet. 1:15, 16).
 
Meditating upon God’s holiness leads us to reflect His holiness in our own lives (2 Cor. 3:18). Ellen G. White states clearly, “It is a law of the mind that it gradually adapts itself to the subjects upon which it is trained to dwell.”—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 596. The purpose of this week’s lesson is twofold: to help class members to understand the importance of pursuing a life of holiness and to encourage them to develop that holiness in their own lives by beholding God’s holiness in His Word.

**Opening Discussion:** When you think of God’s holiness, what comes to your mind? If you had to draw a picture of a holy God, how would you draw it? Are the images of a holy God in your mind positive or negative images? Why? What emotions does the thought of God’s holiness evoke in you? 

For some people, the thought of a holy God instills reverence and awe. For others, it instills fear and condemnation. There are those who equate God’s holiness with His hatred of sin; and because they know that they have sinned, they are overwhelmed with their own guilt in the light of God’s holiness. In this week’s lesson, we will discover that love is at the very foundation of God’s holiness and that His grace flows from His holiness. A holy God is a just God. His justice is the very basis of a universe free from the ravages of sin.

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. Why do you think it is popular to emphasize God’s love but neglect His holiness?
2. Is God’s holiness a gift or a command, or both? Why?
3. What is the difference between holiness and perfection?

#### STEP 2—Explore

**Just for Teachers**: There is a tension in the life of each Christian. This tension is between what we are and what we long to be. It is the tension between the real and the ideal. As committed Christians, we long to reflect the image of Jesus in all of our actions, but, at times, we fall far short of our desires. The good news is that we are accepted in Christ, redeemed by Christ, and justified by Christ. We receive salvation through His sacrifice, not by achieving some state of superholiness (Eph. 1:6, 7; 2:8; Rom. 5:8–10). In the context of His love and grace, we seek to be like Him. His love motivates us to seek His holiness (2 Cor. 5:14, 15). We desire to be like Him because we have been redeemed by His grace (1 John 3:1, 2). 

Concentrate on this thought throughout this week’s lesson: we seek holiness because we have been redeemed by His grace and long to imitate His character. As Scripture says, “We love Him because He first loved us” (1 John 4:19, NKJV).

### **Bible Commentary**

1. **Living a Holy Life** (Review Hebrews 12:2 with the class.)

In Hebrews 11, God outlines His Hall of Fame of the faithful. Chapter 12 begins with these words: “Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us” (Heb. 12:1, NKJV). The metaphor of the “cloud of witnesses” conveys the idea of an athlete competing in an ancient stadium with thousands of witnesses cheering him on. The apostle Paul here states that the examples of past heroes of faith should encourage us as we race toward the kingdom. Their examples also encourage us to pursue lives of holiness. The “sin which so easily ensnares us” is simply a lack of faith that directs our eyes from Christ’s righteousness and leads us to depend on our own. It is the fatal flaw that focuses on human endeavors rather than on divine grace. It is depending on our weakness rather than on Christ’s strength.

The apostle urges each believer to look to Jesus, the “author and finisher of our faith” (Heb. 12:2). The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary puts it this way: “To keep the eye of faith fixed upon Jesus is to maintain uninterrupted contact with Him who is the source of power, Him who can strengthen us to endure and to overcome.”—Volume 7, p. 481. The word for “finisher” in Hebrews 12:2 is the Greek word telei-ot-es, which means the one who completes, perfects, or finishes. 

Jesus is both our Savior and Lord. He is the One who died for us and the One who lives for us. He is the One who justifies and sanctifies us. He is the One who began a good work in us and will finish it. Through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Godhead, we “grow in grace, and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Pet. 3:18). Through Christ, we who are unholy are accepted as holy and through His grace made holy.

**Consider This**: In Romans 7:12, the apostle Paul describes the law of God as “holy, righteous and good” (NIV). Throughout the Bible, God also is described as holy (Isa. 6:3), just (1 John 1:9), and good (Ps. 25:8). If these are the characteristics of both God and the law, what does this equivalence tell you about the very nature of the law? What relationship does living a Spirit-filled life have with the law of God? Discuss this statement with your class: “You can attempt to keep the law without love, but you cannot truly love without keeping the law.”

#### STEP 3—Apply

**Just for Teachers**: In our feel-good, often self-centered society, the concepts of self-denial, obedience, and holiness may seem unintelligible to most people. Help your class understand that the very essence of the Christian life is that believers, saved by grace and transformed by God’s love, naturally seek holiness. When you admire someone, you strive to be like the one you most admire. Christ’s love wins our hearts, and we long to be like Him in character.

**Application Questions:**

1. How can we develop new habits and practices to guide us on our journey to holiness?
2. What are the things in our lives that distract us from living holy lives?
3. Why does living a life of holiness seem so challenging at times?

#### STEP 4—Create

**Just for Teachers**: Pursuing holiness is really pursuing God and desiring to be like Him in character. Help your class understand that the Holy Spirit will produce holiness in the lives of all who spend time seeking God through prayer and His Word.

**Activities:**
1. Ask your class to share what new concepts of holiness they discovered in this week’s lesson.
2. Pass out a blank four-by-six-inch index card to each class member. Ask each student to write a prayer for holiness on his or her card in just three or four sentences. (Where supplies are unavailable, ask class members to quietly compose their prayers in their hearts.) Here is one example of a prayer for holiness.

Dear Lord,

Today, I long to be more like You. At times, I feel too rushed to spend time in Your presence. Please forgive me for my busyness. Slow me down long enough to hear Your voice. Change me by Your Holy Spirit, and may I live the life of holiness that You have called me to.

In Jesus’ name, amen.
