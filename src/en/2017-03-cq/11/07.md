**Exploration**: Rom. 13:8; 1 Cor. 7:23; Gal. 5:1–15

**Conclude**

Our salvation is free—yet it cost our Savior an incalculable price. Life in Jesus equals freedom—yet if we exploit that freedom to just do whatever we desire, we enslave ourselves anew. How do we resolve this tension? Through the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit empowers us to serve God and love others.The Spirit empowers us to escape the chains of sin and the self-enforced prison of perfectionism. When we know that nothing we can do can either earn or take away God’s love, we are empowered to live to give God glory.

**Consider**

- Sketching an image of breaking the bonds of spiritual slavery.
- Examining your heart as to how captive you may yet be to old patterns of thinking and acting.
- Refuting arguments against perfectionism and licentiousness.
- Dancing an interpretive dance that illustrates the freedom you’ve found in Jesus.
- Singing and/or playing “Jesus, I Come,” no. 292 in the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal.
- Brainstorming ways you can live life to the fullest in Jesus.
- Journaling on what it means to “love one another.”
