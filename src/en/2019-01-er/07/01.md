_The seven last trumpets show to God’s people that Heaven cares very deeply about their suffering._

**READ FOR THIS WEEK’S LESSON**: Revelation 8:5, 13; Ezekiel 10:2; Revelation 10:1–4; Daniel 12:6, 7; Revelation 11:1, 2, 3–6.

> <p>MEMORY VERSE:</p>
> “And when the seventh angel blows his horn, God will put His secret plan into action. It will be done just as He told it to the early preachers, His servants” (Revelation 10:7, NLV).

**WHEN JESUS OPENED THE 5TH LOCK**, we saw that the cry of God’s suffering people was a word picture for all God’s loyal followers who ever suffered on the earth. John showed us this group of people as souls under the altar in heaven’s sanctuary. Heaven’s sanctuary is the place where God works to save His people. The souls under the altar shout to God. They ask how long it will be before God makes things fair (Revelation 6:10). The voice from heaven tells the souls to wait, because soon God will judge the people who hurt them. Revelation 6:15–17 show us Jesus when He comes back to this earth. At that time, Jesus will judge everyone who hurt His loyal people.

The suffering of God’s people shown in the 5th seal is a word picture for the suffering of all God’s people from Abel until the time when God will judge the ones who spilled “ ‘the blood of His servants’ ” (Revelation 19:2, NKJV). Until then, God’s suffering people must believe that God hears their prayers. The seven last trumpets show us that God already judged the ones who hurt His followers and that Heaven cares deeply about His people’s suffering.
