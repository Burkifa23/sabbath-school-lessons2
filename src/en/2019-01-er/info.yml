  description: "A lmost 2,000 years ago, the Roman government sent Jesus’ follower John to Patmos. Patmos is a small, rocky island in the Aegean Sea. The Roman government sent John there because he preached the Good News about Jesus. John was very old when the Roman government sent him to Patmos. As a prisoner on Patmos, John suffered awful things. One Sabbath day, Jesus visited John there in a vision. Jesus came to give hope to John during his time of suffering. Jesus also came to give John visions about future happenings in the church, from John’s day until Jesus’ Second Coming and beyond."
